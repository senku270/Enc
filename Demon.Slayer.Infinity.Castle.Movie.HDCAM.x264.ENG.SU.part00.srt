1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,720
Muzan will come someday.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,180
Please, use me as bait to take Muzan's head.

3
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,740
Why do you think that way?

4
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,500
I just feel it.

5
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,420
There's no logic to it. The other children

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,100
wouldn't agree to using me as bait.

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,200
This is a mission I can only entrust to you.

8
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,980
That man won't die even if you cut off his head.

9
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:21,720
I believe the only thing that can destroy Muzan is sunlight.

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Even if you destroy his head and he doesn't die, it'll become a battle to hold him off until sunrise.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,980
Giyuu!

12
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,460
If that's your request,

13
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,160
Thank you.

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:58,660
I pray that no more of my precious children will die.

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,580
So, you thought you could corner me like this?

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,980
You're all headed to hell.

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,420
You annoying Demon Slayers!

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,440
Tonight, I'll make you all my prey!

19
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,560
The ones going to hell are you demons!

20
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,940
I won't let you escape!

21
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,380
Let's do this.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,939
If you can.

23
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,520
Tanjiro Kamado!

24
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,859
Defeat them!

25
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,180
Muzan must fall!

26
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,780
Where am I?

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,720
Everything's upside down and all over the place!

28
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,600
Is the enemy's castle

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,840
a constructed space?

30
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,520
I can't grasp the situation.

31
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,280
Tanjiro was fighting so fiercely.

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,880
But...

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,540
I don't know how long he can keep it up.

34
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,400
Calm down, Zenitsu!

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,540
Y-Yes!

36
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,020
Stay close!

37
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,460
Ugh...

38
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,880
Ah...

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,940
AHHH!

40
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,580
There!

41
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,160
You'll be crushed to death!

42
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,340
Unleash your technique and cut through to the core!

43
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,860
There's something controlling this building!

44
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,500
My footing is bad.

45
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,960
It's hard to brace myself against the fall!

46
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,320
The whole thing...

47
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,860
is at a vanishing distance!

48
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,800
You see the darkness

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,380
Shake your head

50
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,160
Like a light

51
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,640
Leave all the mirrors

52
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,400
To the moon

53
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,040
Ha, ha, ha!

54
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,020
Are you okay?

55
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,340
Yes, thank you!

56
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,020
You saved me!

57
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,960
Water Breathing, Flowing Dance!

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,660
Everyone, come on!

59
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,680
This game...

60
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,520
Hmm...

61
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,240
Giyuu-san is incredible!

62
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,240
He reads my slightest movements and predicts my techniques!

63
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,640
Then he counters with his own techniques, moving so we don't clash!

64
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
This guy is unreal!

65
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,440
What's with that smug look?!

66
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,800
Nnnn...

67
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,680
This must be...

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,640
the demon's stronghold that Shinazugawa and Iguro mentioned.

69
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,740
If so, Kibutsuji's goal in gathering us here is to wipe out the Demon Slayer Corps, including the Hashira.

70
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,260
From here on, we must be even more vigilant.

71
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:30,900
Yes!

72
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's go!

73
00:08:42,720 --> 00:09:00,820
Like this...

74
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,260
Where's Oyakata-sama?

75
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,180
He was caught in a moment of carelessness.

76
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,740
It was the end for him.

77
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,640
That man...

78
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,600
I can't believe he'd make a mistake that would let a demon find him.

79
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,620
To sacrifice himself...

80
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:27,800
Exactly.

81
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,620
There was no way to avoid it.

82
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:55,500
Oyakata-sama was always encouraging me when I was attacked by a demon and my mind was on the brink.

83
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,360
The other Hashira were doing the same at that moment.

84
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,080
Like a father.

85
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes, I know.

86
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,080
Muzan took not only my brother but our father as well.

87
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,660
Damn you, Muzan!

88
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,640
I'll slaughter you! I'll send you to hell!

89
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,200
Rest assured.

90
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,740
We all feel the same.

91
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,060
Oyakata-sama...

92
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,660
We couldn't protect him.

93
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,220
Stupid

94
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,260
Hell yeah!

95
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,160
What is this place?

96
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,340
My Nezuko and the others...

97
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,000
Big brother...

98
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,680
Please, big brother, stay alive!

99
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,360
I heard a sound...

100
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,379
That guy might be nearby.

101
00:12:50,480 --> 00:13:01,260
I smell blood.

102
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:09,580
Where am I?

103
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,080
Demon Slayers...

104
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,800
Quit the Demon Slayer Corps.

105
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,200
You're trying so hard,

106
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,420
really trying so hard,

107
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,740
but you'll probably die fighting Muzan.

108
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,060
Live a normal girl's life and find happiness.

109
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,139
I want you to live until you're an old lady.

110
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,280
You've done enough.

111
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,080
No!

112
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,940
I absolutely won't quit!

113
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,420
I'll definitely take down Muzan!

114
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,820
Tell me!

115
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,380
What kind of demon was it?

116
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,940
Who killed her?

117
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,220
Himejima-san! Tell me!

118
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,080
Please!

119
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,600
To have this happen...

120
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,320
I can't live with such injustice!

121
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,840
Himejima-san!

122
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,040
It was a demon covered in blood from head to toe.

123
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,180
Hey there.

124
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,860
Nice to meet you.

125
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,580
My name is Douma.

126
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,460
It's a nice night, isn't it?

127
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,500
Smiling brightly without a care.

128
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,540
Speaking calmly and gently.

129
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,200
Help... Help!

130
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:20,760
Help!

131
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,100
Shh... I'm talking, aren't I?

132
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,080
Hm?

133
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,100
Are you okay?

134
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,540
Whoa! You're fast!

135
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,820
Are you a Hashira?

136
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:50,860
Oh, don't worry! Just leave them there; I'll eat them properly later.

137
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:52,660
Here you go.

138
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:00,939
When you use those bones, they're sharp and precise.

139
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:07,800
I am the leader of the Eternal Paradise Cult.

140
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,220
My goal is to bring happiness to everyone in the cult.

141
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,700
I'll eat that child cleanly, without leaving anything behind.

142
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,340
This is the demon who killed my sister!

143
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,680
Everyone's happiness, you ruined it!

144
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,180
That person was begging for help!

145
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,460
So I saved her, didn't I?

146
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,140
That child is no longer in pain,

147
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:42,200
no longer suffering, no longer afraid.

148
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,600
That's why I'm eating her.

149
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,380
She'll live on with me.

150
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,320
For eternity.

151
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,580
I take the feelings of the believers,

152
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,520
their blood and flesh, and save them,

153
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,960
guiding them to a higher plane.

154
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,060
You don't seem sane.

155
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,700
Is your head okay?

156
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,040
You make me sick.

157
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,180
Ugh...

158
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,680
Oh, I see. Poor thing. You must have gone through something painful.

159
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,020
Let me listen. Tell me about it.

160
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,640
Pain? There's no such thing! You killed my sister!

161
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,640
Don't you recognize this haori?!

162
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,980
My breathing is stopping.

163
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,600
I can't see it yet.

164
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,320
That's some pull.

165
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,960
I couldn't stop it with my hands.

166
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,340
Repel technique!

167
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,880
Puzzle High-Con!

168
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,420
So strong...

169
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,640
High-Lostack is getting overwhelmed.

170
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,280
Fast, so fast!

171
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,640
But it's just brute force.

172
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,000
You can't save your sister with raw power.

173
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,040
The neck!

174
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,560
I have to cut the neck!

175
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,660
You can't kill with strength alone, but what about me?

176
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,640
Let's see if this poison works on an Upper Rank.

177
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Sister, please...

178
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,200
Sister...

179
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,480
This poison is stronger than the one used on Rui's mountain.

180
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,760
As expected, information was shared.

181
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,040
The poison is extremely potent.

182
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,900
They're adapting the information for each demon.

183
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,640
That man was lost too...

184
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,720
This is fun!

185
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,120
Eating poison is so interesting!

186
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm getting addicted!

187
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,460
Think the next mix will work?

188
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,660
Let's try it!

189
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,280
Right.

190
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,720
Sounds good.

191
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,040
Well...

192
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,640
This was within expectations.

193
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,400
Is the talk over?

194
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,860
Come at me anytime.

195
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,200
I said try it,

196
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,820
but the same technique is boring.

197
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,840
Slower than before, huh?

198
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,180
Like this...

199
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,460
Pure white hair is a sign of innocence.

200
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,400
This child is special.

201
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,380
She must hear the voice of God.

202
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,900
My parents' stupidity was hopeless.

203
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,260
Otherwise,

204
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,840
they wouldn't have created such a dull religion as the Eternal Paradise Cult.

205
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,640
I felt sorry for them,

206
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,720
so I always played along.

207
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,940
I never once heard the voice of God.

208
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,380
At first,

209
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,100
I was worshipped and prayed to by everyone,

210
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,120
and it honestly troubled me.

211
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,320
Children came crying to me,

212
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,040
saying they were suffering, in pain.

213
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,560
Adults would ask me what to do,

214
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,680
and I worried if their heads were okay.

215
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,300
After telling me their tragic life stories,

216
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,600
they'd bow and beg me to guide them to paradise.

217
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,200
I cried.

218
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,660
Poor things.

219
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,860
Paradise doesn't exist.

220
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,820
It's a fairy tale humans made up in their delusions.

221
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,240
Neither God nor Buddha exists.

222
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,400
These people, living for decades,

223
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,780
can't understand such a simple truth.

224
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,360
When you die, you become nothing.

225
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,960
You feel nothing.

226
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,880
Your heart stops,

227
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,540
your brain stops,

228
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,740
and you rot back into the earth.

229
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,460
That's the fate of all living things.

230
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,100
They can't accept such a simple truth.

231
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,780
Being stupid is painful, isn't it?

232
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,620
I want to make these pitiful people happy.

233
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,920
I want to save them. That's why I

234
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,480
was born.

235
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,520
Fifth try... no good. It didn't work.

236
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,100
It's becoming less effective. How many more times can you mix poison?

237
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,060
Oh, you're out of breath. Sweating a lot. You okay?

238
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,220
This is the strength of an Upper Rank.

239
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,860
The poison isn't working at all.

240
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,520
Its resistance builds up abnormally fast!

241
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,460
The poison is starting to affect you.

242
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,200
Tough, huh? You inhaled my Blood Demon Art earlier.

243
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,020
Argh! No way! You're too small!

244
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,940
Why are my hands so small?

245
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,540
Why didn't I grow taller?

246
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,900
If I were just a bit bigger,

247
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,900
could I have cut off the demon's head and defeated it?

248
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,820
The longer your arms and legs, the more muscle you have,

249
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,400
giving you an advantage.

250
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,320
My sister was small, but she was stronger than me.

251
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:47,460
Himejima-san is amazing. If he came to help, everyone would feel safe.

252
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,800
The words my sister would have said at that moment...

253
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,320
I know them.

254
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,380
Is this really the end?

255
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,280
No choice, huh?

256
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,100
The Demon Slayers will probably lose to that demon.

257
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,260
She told me to give up.

258
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,380
Get a grip!

259
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,240
I won't forgive crying!

260
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,760
Sister, stand up!

261
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,860
I can't stand. I'm exhausted.

262
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,840
My throat is slashed, and I can barely breathe.

263
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,740
That doesn't matter. Stand up!

264
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,480
Insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho!

265
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,000
If you decide to defeat it, defeat it. If you decide to win, win!

266
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,880
Win at any cost, with me and Kanao.

267
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,840
That's what we promised, right?

268
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,680
Kanao...

269
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,740
Sorry, sorry. It hurts because I only half-cut it, right?

270
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,660
The Demon Slayers can do it properly. Keep going!

271
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,260
You're standing? Really standing? Wow!

272
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,260
Are you really human?

273
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,940
Your collarbone, lungs, and fat are cut,

274
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,180
and with your size and that amount of blood loss, you should be dead.

275
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,640
Listen! There's blood in your lungs, making gurgling sounds!

276
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,760
That must be unimaginable pain!

277
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
I'll quickly cut off your head,

278
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
so don't push yourself.

279
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,600
You can't be saved anymore, so don't be stubborn.

280
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,360
If you're going to aim, go for the vital point—the neck.

281
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,940
If you can drive poison into the neck, there's still a chance.

282
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,280
Insect Breathing,

283
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,080
like this...

284
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,720
Huh?

285
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,060
A chaotic mess!

286
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,940
"Movements buried in the firing of death."

287
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,120
"An aura strong enough to split a bridge."

288
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,860
So fast... I can't read the attacks...

289
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,060
So low...

290
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,040
The path to happiness...

291
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,140
I believed it stretched on forever and ever.

292
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:35,320
Only when it was destroyed did I realize that happiness was resting on fragile glass.

293
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,440
And just as we were saved,

294
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,200
I wanted to grow stronger to protect someone else's unbroken happiness.

295
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,020
That's right, we made a promise.

296
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:58,480
Yes, we promised.

297
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,420
To defeat the demons.

298
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,040
Together, to take down as many as we can.

299
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,760
So that no one else has to feel the same pain we did.

300
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,360
Even if our strength is weak,

301
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,660
even if we can't cut a demon's neck, defeating just one demon could save dozens of people.

302
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,660
If we can defeat an Upper Rank, we could save hundreds of people.

303
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,220
It's not about whether we can do it.

304
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,340
It's about what we must do.

305
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,160
Are you angry?

306
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,840
Yes, I'm angry.

307
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,960
Tanjiro-kun, I've been angry for a long, long time.

308
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,740
My parents were killed. My sister was killed.

309
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,220
Even Kanao's fellow Tsuguko were killed.

310
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,500
Those girls,

311
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,180
if they were still alive,

312
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,700
if they hadn't been killed by demons,

313
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,780
they'd be living happily with their families.

314
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,720
It really pisses me off.

315
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,280
Don't screw with me, you bastard!

316
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,540
Why isn't the poison working on this guy?!

317
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,940
You damn idiot!

318
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,620
The foolishness of persevering despite everything being futile.

319
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,679
That's the fragility of humans, and the beauty of humans.

320
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,440
You're someone who makes me feel uplifted.

321
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,560
Let's live together forever.

322
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,260
Any last words?

323
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,940
I'll listen.

324
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,320
Go to hell.

325
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,880
Master!

326
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,760
He's definitely here somewhere.

327
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,940
That guy has to face me, no matter what.

328
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,080
Loved ones and precious people...

329
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,800
You vaguely feel they'll be alive tomorrow, the day after.

330
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,940
But that's just a wish.

331
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,200
Flower Breathing!

332
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,920
There's no such thing as an absolute promise.

333
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,980
Fourth Form!

334
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,340
Crimson Hanagoromo!

335
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,540
Phew, that was close, close!

336
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,940
They're always alive, by my side.

337
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,620
For some reason, people tend to believe that.

338
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,840
Don't get in the way while I'm absorbing them.

339
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,740
Oh?

340
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,440
You didn't fall for the bait.

341
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,500
Did this kid just use sign language earlier?

342
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,460
Did she tell you about my abilities?

343
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,160
In just a moment, that's impressive.

344
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
But it's pointless.

345
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,400
Such a hard worker, huh?

346
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Man, even so,

347
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,280
tonight is a great night.

348
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,560
One fine feast after another keeps coming.

349
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,400
Ah, truly,

350
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,080
a wonderful night.

351
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,640
You're there, aren't you?

352
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,720
Come out.

353
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,280
I know you're there.

354
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,060
You need to learn how to talk to your brother.

355
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,220
To your senior.

356
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,480
Have you grown a bit more mature?

357
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,400
Still looking as pathetic as ever, huh?

358
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,600
It's been a while.

359
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,860
Zenitsu.

360
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,280
Kaigaku... you, who became a demon...

361
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:36,980
I no longer think of you as my brother.

362
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,380
Ah!

363
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,220
Water Breathing... Wind Slash...

364
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,140
Free Flow!

365
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,780
Do it!

366
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,520
Draw the blood!

367
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,300
Yes!

368
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,720
This world is insane.

369
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,740
The entire building is pulsing and writhing,

370
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,040
like it's alive.

371
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,440
It's trying to crush Giyuu-san and me.

372
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,100
We need to join up with the other Hashira as soon as possible

373
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,780
and head toward Muzan without getting separated.

374
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:18,700
Death!

375
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,200
Shinobu Kocho, death.

376
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,660
Due to combat with Upper Rank Two.

377
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,820
Death.

378
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,300
Yes.

379
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,320
What's the status of the other Hashira and the slain Demon Slayers?

380
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,720
They're in the center of the twelve-layered shield.

381
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,880
The Hashira are fighting demons, over ten of them.

382
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,540
Beyond that wall, more than thirty demons are approaching.

383
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,360
It continues.

384
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,020
What incredible power.

385
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,580
This is...

386
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,420
the infinite demon castle.

387
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,780
We were lured

388
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
into this infinite demon castle.

389
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,660
However,

390
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,120
we weren't just lured here.

391
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,520
Father made meticulous preparations

392
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,340
to face this day, to connect our fates.

393
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,140
He arranged the Hashira to rush to each other's aid,

394
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,360
and ensured the strongest Demon Slayers became Pillars,

395
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,800
entrusting Kasugai Crows with messages and waiting for the right moment.

396
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,420
With the help of Tamayo-san and Yushiro-san,

397
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:18,860
and to make it complete,

398
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:25,500
our parents and sisters gave their lives as well.

399
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,220
We won't lose this battle.

400
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:45,100
In this vast space, five immense forces radiate as if exerting their power.

401
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,500
Are these the Upper Ranks?

402
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,500
One of them is active at the same location where Shinobu was.

403
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,560
Upper Rank Six and Agatsuma are fighting together.

404
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,320
Upper Rank... Are there other Hashira?

405
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,000
No! It's just Agatsuma alone!

406
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,940
One Hinoe-rank slayer against an Upper Rank is tough.

407
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,240
Go help immediately!

408
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,140
You haven't changed, huh?

409
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,160
Short and pathetic.

410
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,380
Still such a weakling.

411
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,540
Have you gotten used to being a Hashira?

412
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,460
Hey, have you learned to use anything other than the First Form?

413
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,420
You got into the Upper Ranks by filling in the gaps,

414
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,660
and you seem pretty pleased about it.

415
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,660
Heh, you've learned to talk big, haven't you?

416
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,580
Why the hell did you become a demon?

417
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,600
Hahaha, to you,

418
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,300
someone with the talent for Thunder Breathing, why become a demon?

419
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:01,300
Because you became a demon, Jii-chan...

420
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,440
Jii-chan died by seppuku.

421
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,380
He cut his own stomach alone, without a second to assist.

422
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,940
When you commit seppuku, if no one cuts off your head, you suffer for a long time before dying!

423
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,000
He died using his own throat and heart!

424
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,820
He became a demon after mastering Thunder Breathing!

425
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:37,840
Who cares? So what? Should I feel sad?

426
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,860
Should I repent?

427
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,940
I don't bother with people who don't value me.

428
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,220
I always

429
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,960
no matter the time,

430
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,100
side with those who properly value me.

431
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,040
If that old man died suffering, good riddance.

432
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,300
I did so much for him,

433
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,880
but he didn't respect me.

434
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,940
He called a piece of trash like you a successor alongside me, that damn old man.

435
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,620
A former Hashira or not, I have no use for a senile old man.

436
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,620
Jii-chan wasn't senile. If I'm trash, you're scum.

437
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,380
Me, who could only master the First Form, and you, who could master every form except the First.

438
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,980
I feel so sorry for Jii-chan, who had no worthy successors.

439
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,380
You and I...

440
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,980
Don't you dare compare us!

441
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,400
Thunder Breathing...

442
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,200
Fourth Form!

443
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,600
Genius!

444
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,020
You're too slow, scum.

445
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,620
I got cut. This guy's fast.

446
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,540
His movements are like a different person.

447
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,780
I'm not wrong.

448
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,300
Kneeling to an overwhelmingly strong opponent isn't shameful.

449
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,980
As long as you survive, there's always a way.

450
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,760
You're not defeated until you die, even if you grovel or rub your head in the dirt.

451
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:49,500
Even if your house burns down, you drink muddy water, or your theft is exposed,

452
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:56,260
as long as you live, you can win someday. I'll show you victory.

453
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,280
That's what I've believed and followed.

454
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,140
Become a demon.

455
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,020
Do you desire even greater strength?

456
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,180
If you earn his approval,

457
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,140
you could join us.

458
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,360
The stronger the swordsman,

459
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,260
the longer it takes to become a demon.

460
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,560
It took me three days.

461
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,300
To turn someone who uses Breathing into a demon,

462
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,700
they need to receive a large amount of his blood.

463
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:44,340
And there are those whose bodies resist becoming demons,

464
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,060
but what about you?

465
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,440
What a generous offer.

466
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,100
But betraying that trust is absolutely forbidden.

467
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,160
If you betray it,

468
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,360
your head will roll alongside Douma's.

469
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,520
A tearful farewell.

470
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:13,760
That...

471
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,180
The terror that makes every cell in my body

472
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,660
scream and cry out.

473
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,560
Compared to that, this small fry is nothing.

474
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,000
Even with gained strength, you can't match an Upper Rank.

475
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,940
Agatsuma, this guy is trash.

476
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,420
Always crying and whining.

477
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,280
No skill, no guts.

478
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,640
Help me!

479
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,140
That damn old man called a weakling like you a successor alongside me.

480
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,400
Kaigaku,

481
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,860
Jii-chan...

482
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,200
He was a bit bigger than you,

483
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,920
but you and I being together?

484
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,600
No way in hell.

485
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,440
You deserve to die.

486
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,300
Both you and that old man deserve to die.

487
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,860
I could only master the First Form,

488
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,120
while you mastered every form except the First.

489
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,780
That's why Jii-chan

490
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,760
saw both of us

491
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,500
as joint successors of Thunder Breathing.

492
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,740
But you,

493
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,900
you wanted to deny that even by becoming a demon.

494
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,220
Thunder Breathing, Sixth Form.

495
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,100
Here we go!

496
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,180
Five consecutive strikes in a single breath.

497
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,220
You landed a big hit!

498
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,140
You can't even tell good from evil anymore!

499
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,119
I can tell good from evil.

500
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,880
What's wrong?

501
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,100
You're Muzan's favorite, aren't you?

502
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,140
Someone who received five vials from Muzan,

503
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,520
show me that power, you dragon!

504
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,940
What's wrong?

505
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,720
Are you out of steam?

506
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,620
Come on, hit me with it!

507
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,420
Thunder Breathing,

508
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:46,880
First Form.

509
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,520
Heh!

510
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,720
Thunderclap and Flash.

511
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,220
Hahaha!

512
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,380
Just charging straight in with that basic form?

513
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,040
You think that'll hit me?!

514
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,240
Thunder Breathing,

515
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,600
Third Form.

516
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,580
Thunder Swarm!

517
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:41,400
Like this, Aria!

518
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,420
I won't hold back!

519
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,400
How's that?

520
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,660
The sharpness of my blade, honed by my techniques,

521
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,440
cuts through skin and flesh,

522
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,960
resounding like a deadly poison!

523
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,600
Those who value and recognize me are good.

524
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,400
Those who undervalue and reject me are evil.

525
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,200
Got it? This is my power!

526
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,360
I became a demon!

527
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,700
Whether it's one strike or eight,

528
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,120
you, who can only do that, a successor?

529
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,980
What a ridiculous mistake!

530
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,660
Ya!

531
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:26,300
This is...

532
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the answer you came up with...

533
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,240
I knew it...

534
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,280
I knew, but...

535
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,620
Zenitsu! This is... the end!

536
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,860
Thunder Breathing...

537
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,120
Sixth Form!

538
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,920
Rumble and Flash!

539
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,200
The explosive strikes will keep burning through your body!

540
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,240
Burn my power into your eyes and body!

541
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,180
I surpassed Thunder Breathing by becoming a demon!

542
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,120
I'm special!

543
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,560
I'm different from you!

544
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,120
Different from all of you!

545
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,140
As expected, Jii-chan made a mistake!

546
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,240
Kaigaku, you bastard!

547
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,000
A brother like you!?

548
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,020
The First Form of Thunder Breathing is the foundation of all forms, right?

549
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,940
If you can't use the First Form, then no matter what,

550
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,980
mastering the other forms doesn't mean much.

551
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,520
And yet, that guy Kaigaku acted so high and mighty.

552
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,760
He didn't become anything great.

553
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,800
He'll probably die soon.

554
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,580
Take that!

555
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,600
Even if you hit an Upper Rank,

556
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:13,580
don't cause trouble, you trash. Having someone like you around is such a pain.

557
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,400
I knew full well that Kaigaku hated me,

558
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,140
and I hated Kaigaku too.

559
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,100
But I respected him, from the bottom of my heart.

560
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,600
You worked hard and always looked forward.

561
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:40,180
I was always watching your back. You were special.

562
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,840
To Jii-chan, you were a special and precious person to me, but...

563
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,480
that wasn't enough, was it? No matter the time,

564
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,840
I could hear the sound of your discontent.

565
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,840
I could hear the sound of your discontent.

566
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,740
There’s a hole in the box that holds the happiness in your heart.

567
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,700
Happiness keeps spilling out.

568
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,980
If you don’t notice and patch that hole quickly, you’ll never be fulfilled.

569
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,900
Jii-chan.

570
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,140
I’m sorry.

571
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,560
Our paths...

572
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,359
have diverged.

573
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,740
Still got some strength left…

574
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,000
What?

575
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,060
I’m sorry,

576
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,200
big brother.

577
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,580
This place...

578
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,820
Ngh…

579
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,740
You didn’t escape…

580
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,760
What was that technique…?

581
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,580
Too fast…

582
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,460
A form I don’t know!

583
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,040
What did you use?

584
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,680
Damn it… damn it!

585
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,080
That old man really favored you, huh!

586
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,580
He taught you alone and not me!

587
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,600
No…

588
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,260
He created a seventh form.

589
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,740
That guy,

590
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,260
who could only use the First Form,

591
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,300
surpassed me.

592
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,100
Guh!

593
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,460
I can’t take it.

594
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,720
I can’t take it.

595
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,420
I can’t accept that fact.

596
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,780
To lose to a guy like that…

597
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,200
Am I losing?

598
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,720
It’s driving me insane.

599
00:56:59,140 --> 00:56:59,580
No,

600
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,920
it’s not a loss! He’ll fall and die too.

601
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,760
That guy has no strength left.

602
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,020
He’ll die with me!

603
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,000
Those who don’t give to others will eventually receive nothing.

604
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:21,340
Someone who only takes ends up with nothing.

605
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,580
Because they can’t create anything themselves.

606
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,040
Dying alone is fitting, isn’t it?

607
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,420
Where am I?

608
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,740
Jii-chan!

609
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,040
I’m sorry.

610
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,920
I couldn’t get along with Kaigaku.

611
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,420
I even wrote him letters,

612
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,460
but he never replied.

613
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,980
If I hadn’t been there,

614
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,580
maybe Kaigaku wouldn’t have turned out like that.

615
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,200
Please forgive me.

616
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,300
I couldn’t repay you at all.

617
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,540
While Jii-chan was alive,

618
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,400
I wanted to become a Hashira,

619
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,000
to make you proud,

620
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:30,620
I’m sorry.

621
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,540
Jii-chan, I’m sorry.

622
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,660
You came to hate me.

623
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:41,500
Say something, Jii-chan.

624
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,660
What the—?

625
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,560
It’s tangled around my legs.

626
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,160
What are these?

627
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:54,760
Damn it!

628
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,740
Zenitsu.

629
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,180
You are my pride.

630
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,620
Shut up, Murata! Don’t act like you’re above me!

631
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:55,120
Stay sharp and watch your surroundings. If someone weaker than me gets taken out, I won’t forgive them!

632
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:07,720
I’m a demon, so why should I care about teamwork? I’m using the blood-stopper, but if the cracks on my face don’t heal, I’ll dodge even the urgent ones.

633
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,660
You hear me?

634
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:15,480
Don’t scare someone who’s already weak.

635
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,340
I’m using the blood-stopper too, but the bleeding won’t stop.

636
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,200
Stop it!

637
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,680
You’ll be fine! I’ll definitely save you!

638
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,060
You won’t die!

639
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,460
Hang in there, Agatsuma!

640
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,000
Keep fighting! Keep fighting!

641
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:33,220
The Upper Rank you fought hadn’t fully mastered their techniques or abilities yet.

642
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,000
You got lucky.

643
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,620
If this fight was a year later, you’d be dead instantly.

644
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,320
Don’t say depressing things!

645
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,260
I’m not saying anything wrong!

646
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:58,960
What’s that?

647
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,840
Yelling like that brought a demon!

648
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,500
Perfect timing.

649
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:07,780
Shinobu-san,

650
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,760
we’ll definitely win.

651
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,440
Everyone will,

652
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:13,960
we will.

653
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,800
What’s this shaking?

654
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,260
Giyuu-san!

655
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,280
Stop!

656
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:22,920
Calm down!

657
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,120
Is someone fighting again?

658
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,520
Is someone else going to die?

659
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,820
It’s been a while.

660
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,980
You did well to survive this long,

661
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,580
a weakling like you.

662
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,540
Um…

663
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,880
Tanjiro.

664
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,560
Yakada!

665
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,440
Aaaah!

666
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,160
Huh?

667
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,760
Ugh…

668
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,160
If Muzan dies, the other demons die too.

669
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,400
Then Kibutsuji Muzan is still alive.

670
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:02,360
Muzan’s power is probably being suppressed by Tamayo-san.

671
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:08,060
Even if it’s suppressed, it doesn’t react to Yushiro-san’s eyes.

672
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,220
Before Muzan’s power fully recovers,

673
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,360
we have to defeat him no matter what.

674
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:22,020
But in this infinite castle,

675
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,920
can we really find Kibutsuji Muzan?

676
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,040
No need to rush. You’re doing well.

677
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:47,400
He’ll definitely show himself. He came to me, didn’t he?

678
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,160
That’s the kind of man Kibutsuji Muzan is.

679
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,040
Understood, Father.

680
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,800
I’ll definitely finish this.

681
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,960
We need to find him before the Hashira’s strength runs out

682
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,440
and settle this.

683
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,240
Absolutely! Defeat Kibutsuji!

684
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,420
Please!

685
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,680
Got it.

686
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,120
I’m leaving this to you guys.

687
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,319
Go for it!

688
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,700
Now’s the time! Show the world what you’re made of!

689
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:08,819
Ora!

690
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,380
Mana… thank you.

691
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,080
Everyone’s fighting so hard.

692
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:25,759
Don’t cry.

693
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,819
Never stop moving forward.

694
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,660
We won’t lose.

695
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:34,339
Yes.

696
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:39,380
Lord Kirie,

697
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,859
you’re truly admirable.

698
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,279
Even amidst the pain of losing your father,

699
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,819
you take command of the Demon Slayer Corps

700
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,900
and carry out your mission with resolve.

701
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,020
Hey, Rengoku-san.

702
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:58,600
Exactly.

703
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,779
To inspire the children of the Corps

704
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,380
to stand so firmly like this.

705
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,480
I, too, as a mentor…

706
01:08:10,779 --> 01:08:12,339
must keep running forward.

707
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:15,580
Protecting lives with my own.

708
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,800
You seem to be in pain.

709
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:38,380
The drug that Tamayo, the demon working with the Master, created…

710
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,480
I used it as instructed, but

711
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:48,860
will Nezuko really return to being human?

712
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,600
If Nezuko becomes human again, Muzan’s greatest desire will crumble.

713
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:02,400
The dream of a perfect being he’s pursued for over a thousand years,

714
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:07,400
overcoming the sun, will be reset to nothing.

715
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:18,160
Nezuko is the only one in all these years who doesn’t burn in sunlight.

716
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
Final Phase.

717
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:46,000
The words keep echoing in my mind.

718
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,980
On this journey,

719
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,980
my heart trembles.

720
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:53,520
My pulse races. This long battle might end tonight.

721
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:59,020
To think I’d be alive to witness it.

722
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:06,840
Feel it. Ever since you brought your demon sister,

723
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,980
it’s like a massive gear started turning.

724
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:21,280
If all the battles up to now were part of a giant machine,

725
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:27,940
you and Nezuko, two small gears, clicked into place,

726
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,560
and the stalled situation suddenly surged forward.

727
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,500
Don’t lose, Nezuko.

728
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,980
Don’t lose, Tanjiro.

729
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,380
Don’t lose, everyone!

730
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:49,660
Hinokami Kagura!

731
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:50,660
Here we go!

732
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,080
Go! Go! Go!

733
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,280
I can’t cut their arms!

734
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,580
I can’t cut their necks!

735
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,220
It’s gone.

736
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,220
I dodged the attack.

737
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,280
It’s working.

738
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,280
I can fight.

739
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,960
I couldn’t aim for the neck.

740
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:22,200
Hinokami Kagura! Sunflower Thrust!

741
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:31,100
Hah… Hah… Hah…

742
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,840
Hah… Hah…

743
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,960
Tanjiro… your techniques are finely honed.

744
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,440
Your skill is no exaggeration to say it rivals a Hashira.

745
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,400
To face an Upper Rank Three like this…

746
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,700
That day, in the snow, filled with despair,

747
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,180
weeping as you carried your sister,

748
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:04,960
you, who could only save your sister’s life…

749
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,100
Reveal your intent.

750
01:12:47,099 --> 01:12:49,240
Technique Deployment.

751
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,120
Shall we begin?

752
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,560
Idle.

753
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:59,740
Ugh!
