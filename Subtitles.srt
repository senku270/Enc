1
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:04,500
Filming inside the theater

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,333
Recording is a crime.

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,708
By law, those with less than 10 years of listening experience

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,625
role, or 10 million yen

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,166
Withdrawal of the following, or

6
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,250
Both

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,458
You can earn money.

8
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,333
If you see suspicious behavior

9
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,000
Then, go to the theater.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,833
Please advise.

11
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:21,500
Gnome

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,916
The movie Dorobon.

13
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,125
This movie was shot in less than a day.

14
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:48,500
Then comes Musha.

15
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,541
Take me and

16
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,541
Take San's head.

17
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,958
Why do you think so?

18
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,875
Can it be done?

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,375
I bit it, just

20
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,875
There is no logic to this.

21
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:18,458
The other kids, I

22
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,000
Use yourself to get it

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,291
I understand that

24
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't think so.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,416
I can only rely on you

26
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,208
An unstoppable order.

27
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,791
That man lost his head.

28
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,083
It won't die even if you cut it.

29
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,750
Probably destroys Muzan.

30
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,625
It is not just the light of the fire that

31
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think so.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,041
Even if you break my neck,

33
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,958
If he doesn't die, the fire

34
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,958
The wage war until the

35
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,291
It will be.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,166
Good, that's good.

37
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,708
If it's a favor.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
thank you.

39
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:15,625
Please, this already

40
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:19,083
That's it, my precious child.

41
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,416
We won't die

42
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,458
I hope so.

43
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,541
Follow me now

44
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,208
Are you planning to pack it?

45
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,958
You guys are going now

46
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,666
It's hell.

47
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,000
You filthy devils,

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,666
Tonight everyone is urushi

49
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's do it.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,208
Going to hell

51
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,791
That's a waste of your time.

52
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:08,125
I will never let you get away. Let's try it.

53
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,333
What can be done

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,000
Then, Scythe Battle Giro.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Defeat it!

56
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,250
It's a transfer business!

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,875
What is this place?

58
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,500
Up and down, left and right, up and down.

59
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,166
Take the enemy's end.

60
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,000
Is it Patnaru?

61
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,041
The situation before and after

62
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,625
Don't you understand?

63
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,958
Tamayosan cuts down on waste

64
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:49,916
It was crowded.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But how long will it last?

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,833
I don't know.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,875
Calm down, Master Kanro.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,583
yes!

69
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:07,583
Don't leave.

70
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:15,625
Huff huff huff

71
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,166
Haha are you okay?

72
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,083
Ha thank you

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,666
Ha, that helps

74
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,208
Water breathing passage

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,166
look over

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:45,916
I'll carry it haha haha

77
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,000
Huff huff huff

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,416
Ha ha ha ha

79
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:57,916
Ah, water breathing

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,625
The third person

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,375
Mejunzeyu

82
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,458
Ryumai haa

83
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,041
Ha ha ha ha munch

84
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:15,833
is amazing

85
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,541
What will happen with my slight movement?

86
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,375
Is that a technique?

87
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,291
Haak and then I

88
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,375
They showed their skills and

89
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:22,958
Not compatible

90
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:23,750
Moves like

91
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,916
This guy is crazy

92
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,708
This is the face of my feelings

93
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,500
Uuuuuuuuh

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,791
This is probably the Shinazu River.

95
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,833
Iglo said.

96
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,541
It must be the demon's foot.

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,166
Then, we

98
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,541
The strange things collected here

99
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,583
The purpose is to include the pillars

100
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,750
One layer of the mysterious murder

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,916
Please pay more attention.

102
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,333
Yes, yes.

103
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,791
Let's go!

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,166
Elio Koshu That person

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,875
The eternal sky

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,541
In Cambodia

107
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,750
Get closer, garbage

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,416
Haa, Iguro is saved.

109
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,208
There are no injuries.

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,708
Garbage is shit

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,791
Iguro's Cosmos

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,708
Don't let him have the power of Kagenpeibo

113
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,083
Will this be enough for me?

114
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,875
We are also exhausted

115
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,875
I intend to make

116
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,541
The parent

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,750
People were excited about the past

118
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,041
The majestic Sayotata

119
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,541
That person is found by the demon

120
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,541
Such a failure

121
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,708
I don't think so.

122
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,750
Take yourself

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,875
Yes.

124
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,083
Four years have passed

125
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,000
Because there was no

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,666
Dear Parent,

127
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,791
The boss said that I was attacked by a demon.

128
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,000
The boundaries of the mind are broken

129
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,875
When I was wandering

130
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,250
Please continue to encourage me.

131
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,875
The Ambassador of the time

132
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,708
Ours too

133
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,916
I was doing that

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,125
Like a Father

135
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,791
Ah, I know the unofficial

136
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,666
Not just my brother

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,166
They even took our father away.

138
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,000
No participation, no participation, beaten to death

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,333
Show me the hell I'll do it to you

140
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:58,125
Let's do it, rest assured, everyone is the same

141
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:07,166
I think, parents

142
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,750
I couldn't protect

143
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
One after the other, the movements

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,791
Bring it on

145
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll kill you all.

146
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:48,583
once again

147
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,666
Just one more time

148
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,916
once again

149
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,125
Once more, once more

150
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:05,625
Once more, once more

151
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,791
Once more, once more

152
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,833
Once more, once more

153
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,750
Once again, what

154
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,708
Here's my screw or something else

155
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:26,500
Everyone is like a big brother

156
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,125
Please keep it up

157
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,333
I heard a sound

158
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,583
Is he nearby?

159
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:44,791
I might not forgive

160
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,041
That guy

161
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,416
I will never forgive you

162
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:27,000
Here is something something something something something something something something something something something something

163
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:48,791
Something something something something something something something something something something something something something something something

164
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,333
Later, to Nakime-chan

165
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,666
Thank you

166
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,041
I have to say it

167
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,958
Shinomu's Murdered Body

168
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,208
Stop it

169
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,250
You are stubborn.

170
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,333
Although it is stretched

171
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,500
Really stubborn

172
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,958
Although it is stretched

173
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,833
Maybe Shinom

174
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
The happiness of an ordinary girl

175
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,375
Get it, grandma

176
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,000
Until

177
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,333
I want you to live

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,166
Enough is enough

179
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I will never quit

180
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,708
Something

181
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,916
Be sure to tell me

182
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,458
What kind of demon is it and when?

183
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,541
I can't pay for what I did to you

184
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:05,500
Tell me something like this

185
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,541
I'm just like normal.

186
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,416
I can't live

187
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,333
From the head

188
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,041
Covered in blood

189
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,000
It was such a demon.

190
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,000
No, no, nice to meet you

191
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,083
My name is

192
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,666
Doma, what a nice night

193
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,208
With a smile

194
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,083
Laugh heartily

195
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,708
Calmly and kindly

196
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,875
Speak well

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Help me help me

198
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:46,458
Shi

199
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,500
You're talking now, right?

200
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,250
OK?

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,375
Wow!

202
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,958
That's fast. Is it a pillar?

203
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:04,875
a!

204
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,000
It's okay, just leave it there

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,750
I'll catch up with you later.

206
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,958
Because I'll eat properly

207
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,958
When that demon uses

208
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,041
A sharp dialect

209
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,541
I am the leader of the All Saints Paradise Sect

210
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,875
With everyone at Nano Shrine

211
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,625
It's my job to be happy

212
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,833
Not a single child was left behind

213
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,333
I'll eat cleanly

214
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,208
This guy

215
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,333
The demon who killed my sister

216
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,291
Everyone's happiness was released

217
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,666
This person dislikes

218
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,541
Please help me

219
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,500
Because I was looking for it

220
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,583
I would have saved you.

221
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,750
The child is already suffering

222
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,000
It's not spicy either.

223
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,291
No one to be afraid of

224
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,291
Everyone dies.

225
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,583
Because I'm scared

226
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,958
I'm the one feeding them.

227
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,833
Living with

228
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,416
Let's go on forever

229
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,125
I want to know the thoughts of the shrines.

230
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,375
Blood and flesh firmly

231
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,750
Accept and save,

232
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,083
The courage that leads to

233
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,458
I don't think so.

234
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,833
Is your head okay?

235
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,125
I really hate it

236
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,375
Uuuu, even though it's our first meeting

237
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,708
It's quite soluble.

238
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,250
Hey, I see.

239
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,666
Poor thing, something's wrong

240
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,000
I heard that something happened.

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,791
Let me help you.

242
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,875
Look, there's nothing spicy.

243
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,791
Someone killed my sister

244
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,375
You are the one who owns this haori.

245
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,750
Do you recognize

246
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,458
Ah, using the flower breath

247
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,333
The girl was so kind.

248
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,583
She was a cute girl.

249
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,125
The morning sun rises and I eat there

250
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,916
I remember you were a sleepy kid.

251
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:25,916
Eat properly

252
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,041
How about giving it to me?

253
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,875
My breathing stops a lot

254
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,708
Still can't see it. Amazing.

255
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,291
Pull it out with your hands

256
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,041
I couldn't stop it

257
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,500
Research

258
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,708
Pulsar high-con stand out

259
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,791
Hi-Lo Taclaw

260
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,458
It stands out

261
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,583
Wow it's so fast

262
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,333
But it's inconvenient, the gap

263
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,833
Standing with your stomach together

264
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a no-brainer after all.

265
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,500
I'll cut my neck if I don't

266
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,583
Les can't be killed

267
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,416
How about me?

268
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,291
Bone poison works on the upper limit

269
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,750
Now I know if

270
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:30,000
Please, sister!

271
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,000
This is Louis's. It's you, it's you, it's you.

272
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,208
The poison used on Louis' mountain

273
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:41,291
It's more powerful after all.

274
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,833
The information was shared

275
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,500
Poison is a powerful source of information

276
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,000
If you change it to each demon,

277
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,416
I lost that one too

278
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,625
Uuuuuuuu

279
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,291
Oh, it can break down poison.

280
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,250
It seems like that happened.

281
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,666
Sorry

282
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,708
Even though you used it,

283
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,291
When you put it away

284
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,000
The sound is unique. I wonder if they are changing the poison information there.

285
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,291
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

286
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,166
Eat the fun poison

287
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,333
It's funny

288
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,750
The next information

289
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,916
Then I think you should listen.

290
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:41,625
Let's see it now.

291
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,000
That's fine. I hope you enjoy it.

292
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,416
Up until this area

293
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,708
Because I don't expect it.

294
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,250
Is the compounding done?

295
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:56,916
Come anytime

296
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,000
It's okay

297
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,291
I said try it.

298
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,000
But it's boring to use the same technique.

299
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,708
Not the same technique

300
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,125
That would be boring.

301
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,375
Huh?

302
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,708
From earlier

303
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,750
It's slow

304
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This is not our

305
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,125
Please breathe now

306
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:34,750
It happened!

307
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,708
Huh?

308
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,666
Did you give me a little?

309
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,666
Resistance is well received

310
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,166
It was washed away. Amazing.

311
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,083
I was interested in the tears

312
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,500
It is the culmination of hard work.

313
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Feel free to come, poison

314
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Before decomposition,

315
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,916
I'm adamant that you should point out the attack.

316
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,750
I want to support the people who are posting

317
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,250
That's what happens.

318
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,375
This is already good

319
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,083
I've been a good boy since I was a child.

320
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,125
He was wise and smart.

321
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,458
When will these poor people be killed?

322
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,750
Because I helped you.

323
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,541
That made me happy

324
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,708
Because it is my mission

325
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,958
A rainbow in this child's eyes

326
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,500
The hair of the white crane

327
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,416
Hair is proof of innocence

328
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,125
is a special child, I'm sure God

329
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,541
I can hear the voice

330
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,791
My parents' stupidity

331
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,791
It seemed hopeless.

332
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,791
Otherwise, paradise religion etc.

333
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,000
A boring religion

334
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,916
I can't make it

335
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,750
Because I felt sorry for him.

336
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,750
Always talk

337
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,875
I gave it to you

338
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,416
I have never heard the voice of God

339
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,625
At first, I couldn't surpass it.

340
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,291
They all gathered together in worship

341
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,416
As expected,

342
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,708
I'm in trouble

343
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,791
Crying to the child

344
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,375
It's painful, what should I do?

345
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,458
Adults who say it's okay

346
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,458
Is your head okay?

347
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,958
I'm worried

348
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,791
Fiery

349
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,208
After telling my story

350
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,916
Please lead me to paradise

351
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:31,791
I want it

352
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:32,708
was lowered

353
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,541
I cried

354
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,875
Poor paradise

355
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,875
It doesn't exist, humans

356
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,958
I imagined and created

357
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,583
It's a time story.

358
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,333
There is no God or Buddha

359
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,750
Such a simple thing

360
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,000
These people have been

361
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,750
I'm alive

362
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,791
It's not because

363
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,458
When you die, you become nothing

364
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,458
I just can't feel anything

365
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,291
My heart stopped and my brain

366
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,833
Stop and rot

367
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:07,875
Just return to earth

368
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,791
As a living thing, everything

369
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,583
So it looks bitter

370
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,083
Such a simple thing

371
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,000
I can't accept it

372
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,875
It's hard to be stupid

373
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,958
Make the poor people happy

374
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:24,625
I want to

375
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,666
I want to help

376
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,500
For that reason, I

377
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,250
I was born

378
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,125
The fifth time, this also doesn't work.

379
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,583
Please listen to it

380
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:46,500
It's getting harder

381
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,458
How many more times and where to mix?

382
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,291
I wonder if I can even breathe

383
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:52,958
Not going on any longer

384
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,250
I'm sweating a lot, but it's okay

385
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,708
This is the upper limit of strength

386
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,208
Kotokaku doesn't work

387
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,458
Until you get into position

388
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,166
The speed is abnormal

389
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,875
The defeat is the key

390
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:11,875
Because I do

391
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,541
It's painful, my blood

392
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,041
技術

393
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,166
Because I smoked it

394
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,875
Cut off the stir-frying of stomach iron

395
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,333
Spraying at Nishi Oki

396
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:27,583
Breathing

397
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,208
It is dangerous in itself

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,791
Blitz and the best

399
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,000
Shoot the poison

400
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
In front of the spirit of the road

401
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,041
救減力加減

402
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,708
No, it was really early yesterday

403
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,750
The pillars that existed until now

404
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,875
Maybe the best of the best

405
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,708
Kira

406
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,375
Not the poison, but the neck.

407
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,500
I wish it had been cut

408
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,250
That's how fast it is.

409
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,958
If I had, I might have won.

410
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,875
Ah, that's impossible

411
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,125
Because you're small

412
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,500
Why are my hands

413
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,041
Is it really that small?

414
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,500
Why be more careful?

415
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,583
Didn't it grow?

416
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,958
Just a little bit more body

417
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,541
If it's big, it's the demon's neck.

418
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,000
Could you have cut it and defeated it?

419
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,833
The longer your hands and legs are, the longer

420
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,333
But there is also a lot of muscle mass.

421
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,833
So it's advantageous

422
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,208
My sister was a resident.

423
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:01,125
But there were more rumors than me.

424
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:04,500
Himejima-san is great

425
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,625
That person is coming to help

426
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:08,625
If everyone

427
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,958
It's reassuring.

428
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,833
My sister said that time

429
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:16,708
The words I was trying to say

430
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:19,750
I know

431
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,125
That was the end after all.

432
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,375
It can't be helped.

433
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,708
Maybe the death part will be to that demon.

434
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:37,291
I'll say I'll lose

435
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,000
Stop it

436
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,833
It was

437
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,083
Stay strong!

438
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,375
I won't allow you to cry

439
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,583
Sister, stand up.

440
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,500
Can't stand

441
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,625
The fertilizer from the skin is also

442
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,416
Cut it crisply

443
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,375
I can't even breathe

444
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,958
It doesn't matter.

445
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:09,250
The head of the samurai gang dies

446
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,000
If you decide to defeat them, defeat them.

447
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,208
Do it, I've decided to win.

448
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,041
If so, win.

449
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,333
At all costs

450
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,750
Winning, me and them

451
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,916
You promised me.

452
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:27,791
Kanao

453
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,666
Sorry sorry only half-heartedly

454
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,333
It hurts because I cut it

455
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:41,875
Shinobu will do it properly

456
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,250
Do your best.

457
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,000
oh?

458
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:50,916
picture?

459
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:51,958
Are you standing?

460
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,458
Are you going to stand up?

461
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,083
Yeah, you

462
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,416
Are you really human?

463
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:02,208
Sakotsu lungs and fat

464
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,375
Even though I cut it, your body

465
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,916
With that amount of bleeding

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,500
It's funny even if I'm dead

467
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,333
But I don't have it.

468
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,291
Ah, look, there's blood in your lungs.

469
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,375
I went in and heard a rumbling sound.

470
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,333
The unimaginable pain

471
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,750
I'll take your neck right away.

472
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,458
Drop it

473
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,041
Sorry, I'll give it to you

474
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You can't be saved anymore

475
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,916
Aim without being stubborn

476
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:31,750
Then it's the neck that's the weak spot.

477
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,583
If you inject poison into

478
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,166
There is a dead

479
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,750
Kekokomaman?

480
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:42,000
Reverse Zaku Chabara

481
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,125
Move to bury dead law firing

482
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,291
Walking the bridge

483
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,333
About as much

484
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,291
Fast attacks are unstoppable

485
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:26,291
Low low high high

486
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,541
The path to happiness

487
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,208
Far, far away

488
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,375
It's still going on

489
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,291
I thought

490
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,958
Only after being destroyed

491
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,458
The crow whose happiness is thin

492
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,250
Riding on top of

493
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,458
I realized that it was

494
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,791
And we are the ones who are saved.

495
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:06,500
As if

496
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,916
Not yet destroyed

497
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,791
Someone's happiness

498
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,916
Become stronger

499
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,625
I wanted to protect

500
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:19,708
yes

501
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,541
Promised

502
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,375
Let's defeat the demons

503
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,166
But mostly just two people.

504
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,875
We share the same thoughts

505
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,250
I won't let anyone else

506
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,500
Even if the strength is weak

507
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,750
Even if the demon's head isn't cut off

508
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,791
If you defeat one demon, dozens more

509
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:03,458
If defeating is the limit

510
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:04,916
Hundreds of people

511
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,125
can help

512
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,041
Yes or no

513
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:12,333
No, I have to do it.

514
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,416
There are things that can't be done

515
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
He was angry.

516
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,875
Are you angry?

517
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,666
Yes, I'm angry.

518
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:29,791
Hey, Simple Road, forever.

519
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:34,625
I'm angry all the time.

520
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,500
Parents murdered

521
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,166
My sister was murdered.

522
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,083
Other than money

523
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,291
The heir was also killed.

524
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,833
Those kids too

525
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,958
If it's true, I'm still a demon

526
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:54,666
Kill the hit

527
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,000
If I hadn't been there, I would still be here

528
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,125
Family and happiness

529
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,791
I lived in

530
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,875
It really pisses me off

531
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,375
Don't mess with me, idiot

532
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,458
Why did you come here?

533
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,625
This guy won't do it

534
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,291
Idiot

535
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You idiot, you idiot.

536
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,625
It was impressive. I was moved.

537
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:33,125
This weak girl

538
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,083
I can't believe I could do this much.

539
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,041
Not even better than my sister

540
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,958
But there are often demons

541
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,750
You've done it so far

542
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,833
That I didn't die

543
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:47,958
It's a miracle, everything is in vain

544
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,125
But I'll carry it through

545
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,000
Foolishness is the transience of humanity

546
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,291
The Wonder of Humanity

547
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:57,500
What is it with you? I'm in the sky

548
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,625
He's a terrible person forever.

549
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,000
Let's live together

550
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,083
There's something left to say

551
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:09,250
I'll ask you

552
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:23,000
Go to hell!

553
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:55,875
That idiot

554
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:56,916
I'm sure he's here

555
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
He met me too

556
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,291
I have to

557
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,041
It shouldn't be

558
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,166
People you love or care about

559
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:15,875
Explosively, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow

560
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,000
I feel like I'm still alive

561
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It's just a wish

562
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,333
Only the breath of flowers

563
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,083
I was promised that it would definitely happen.

564
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:27,666
There is nothing

565
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,083
What a terrible death

566
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,125
Flowers in hands

567
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,625
Wow, that's dangerous.

568
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,500
Always alive and by my side

569
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,458
Why are some people

570
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,041
I thought so.

571
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm going to die.

572
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:01,750
While I was absorbing it

573
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,000
Please don't tease me.

574
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:12,833
Oh?

575
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:17,875
This cat won't go extinct

576
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,000
My child just started finger spelling.

577
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,916
Did you do it?

578
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,333
My abilities

579
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:24,750
Did I teach you?

580
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:27,541
It was only for a moment, but it was amazing

581
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:30,000
Hey, it's pointless, but it's easy to try your best, I'll try my best again

582
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,583
I'm going to try my best.

583
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:34,166
It's easy to work hard

584
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,166
Well, even so

585
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,500
It's a beautiful night today

586
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,083
One after the other,

587
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,958
A feast is coming

588
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,875
Really

589
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,166
What a nice night

590
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:27,791
Oh?

591
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,458
Oh?

592
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:28,500
Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh?

593
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:28,583
Oh?

594
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh?

595
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:46,791
Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh?

596
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:51,250
Oh?

597
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:51,750
Oh?

598
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:56,583
Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh?

599
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:56,833
Oh?

600
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:56,958
Oh? Oh?

601
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh? Oh?

602
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:11,916
Oh? Oh?

603
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh?

604
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,458
Oh?

605
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:16,541
Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh?

606
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:16,666
Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh?

607
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,500
Oh?

608
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:52,833
Oh?

609
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh?

610
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:50,500
Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh?

611
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh?

612
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,291
Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh? Other pillars and dealing with being killed

613
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,750
What is our situation?

614
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,458
Shield to death, sideways

615
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,791
Center of the twelve layers

616
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,416
The ambassador is fighting the demon.

617
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:08,041
More than a dozen

618
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,916
And on the back of that wall, 30

619
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:18,750
A demon that exceeds

620
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,416
It's approaching

621
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,291
Furthermore, the person's eyes,

622
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,625
Visualizing Blood Technology

623
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,958
In the eyes of those who can

624
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,666
The invisible art itself

625
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:37,583
This leader of light is a demon

626
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,583
The strength of each blood technique

627
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,750
It must be Sana

628
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,791
And pulsating

629
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,708
The moving sword construction

630
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,000
Also, the technique itself continues on and on.

631
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:57,625
What a power this is

632
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,750
It's an endless demon castle

633
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:07,083
We are these infinite demons

634
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,416
was lured into the castle

635
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:13,000
But just inviting

636
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,500
A Father Who Was Not Born

637
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,625
The party made extensive preparations,

638
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:20,958
Today has arrived

639
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,708
A pillar connects the life and death

640
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,708
Both rushed to the scene.

641
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,833
Promote placement so that

642
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,583
The Demon Slayer Ambassador who was transformed

643
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm going to cut it into pieces.

644
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,541
Give patience to glass

645
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:34,416
Well, I waited.

646
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,416
Tamayosan, Yushiro

647
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:38,500
Your power is also

648
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,000
And to make it complete

649
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:47,541
With my parents and sisters

650
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:54,208
This battle to which I gave my life,

651
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,333
I won't lose

652
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,708
In this large space,

653
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,000
A great force radiates as if exerting force.

654
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
However, this

655
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,291
Upper limit or one of them

656
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,750
is the place where the death tool was

657
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,458
Both are the upper limit for winning!

658
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,666
The Upper Limit of 6 and Ambassador Agatsuma

659
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,625
We met

660
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,500
Upper limit Any other ambassadors?

661
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:25,291
not here!

662
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,291
There is one Agatsuma Ambassador.

663
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,625
Yesterday's ambassador was the limit

664
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,333
Strict hurry and refrain

665
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:41,375
Still the same, shorty

666
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,583
Great to see,

667
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,291
What the hell?

668
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:48,458
Have you gotten used to the pillars?

669
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:53,041
Hey, hey, all 11 of you

670
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,833
Other than that

671
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,000
Did it become?

672
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,208
Upper limit on appropriate hole

673
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,333
I put him at the bottom.

674
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,916
You seem very happy.

675
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,083
Wow

676
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,375
I started to say

677
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:11,583
Hey, why are you a demon?

678
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,625
It has become

679
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,583
You have the breath of Kana

680
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,000
The person who has a ticket for minor injury

681
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,958
Why did you become a demon?

682
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,750
You became a demon

683
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,458
Because of this, Sea-chan

684
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,875
He cut his stomach and died!

685
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:31,583
Shi-chan is

686
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,166
I committed suicide by myself.

687
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,916
Without any adaptations

688
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,208
When I cut my stomach, someone

689
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,291
I can't take your head off.

690
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,208
I've been suffering for a long time

691
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:44,500
die

692
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,833
Shi-chan will be

693
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,500
I can't control my throat or my heart.

694
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,000
And then the dead Kanna's Breath

695
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,041
Use the demon from

696
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:53,958
Only after you let it out!

697
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,750
Who cares?

698
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,333
So what?

699
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:01,875
sorrow?

700
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,000
Should I regret it?

701
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,791
I am the one who doesn't appreciate me

702
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:10,416
I don't care about you

703
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,708
Is always

704
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,500
Rate me correctly

705
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,166
What is it?

706
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,541
My grandfather died in agony.

707
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:22,208
If so, I'll generate it.

708
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,083
That much I

709
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,416
I did everything I could

710
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,833
Don't make me a spectacle

711
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,500
In collaboration with scum like

712
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,541
It's a spectacle.

713
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:34,833
That old bastard is a real old man.

714
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,416
Pillars or pillars

715
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:38,208
To the old man who

716
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,916
Because there's no use

717
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,583
My grandpa is senile

718
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:49,083
I didn't do it, I'm the idiot

719
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:52,250
Then you're trash.

720
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,333
I can only use the form

721
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,791
You can't use it just for the sake of appearance.

722
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,041
I wasn't blessed with a view.

723
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,333
I feel sorry for my grandpa.

724
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:03,583
No way, my name and me

725
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,875
Don't stare

726
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:08,000
No way, Kanai died in an emergency

727
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,541
The

728
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:20,125
Senzayo, trash

729
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:26,958
Cut

730
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,791
This guy is fast

731
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,666
His movements are like a different person

732
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,041
I'm not wrong

733
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,666
Kneeling before an overwhelmingly powerful person

734
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:52,666
There's no shame in that.

735
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,625
As long as I'm alive

736
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,291
It'll work out

737
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:00,666
Until I die

738
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:01,916
Not a loss

739
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,500
Rubbing your head on the ground

740
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,250
Whether you have a home or not

741
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,750
Drinking muddy water can make money

742
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,708
The theft

743
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,958
Even if I am insulted

744
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,458
As long as I'm alive

745
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,250
Someday we will win

746
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,666
I will show you, I believe, and move forward

747
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:22,375
I came here

748
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,125
Becoming a demon

749
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,791
I want more strength

750
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,625
You too are recognized by that person.

751
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,583
If we can,

752
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:38,208
Will be a companion

753
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:45,458
The stronger the swordsman, the more of a demon he becomes.

754
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:47,083
takes time

755
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,666
I was round

756
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,250
Those who can use breathing are demons.

757
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,208
In this case, from that person

758
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,166
There is a lot of blood

759
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:01,416
I must accept it.

760
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,500
And if you don't become a demon

761
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,791
Something precious

762
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,458
There are also

763
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,250
What about you?

764
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:20,416
Thank you for the blood.

765
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:21,958
To spill something

766
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:25,041
I don't understand

767
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:28,333
When you do, your neck

768
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,833
And the torso is sadly separated.

769
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:41,708
Every cell in that body screams

770
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:42,000
I feel like I'm going to cry.

771
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:50,166
But compared to that

772
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:53,291
Such a small thing, but a big deal

773
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,708
I gained the strength that I don't have.

774
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,875
By the way, it doesn't reach the upper limit.

775
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,583
Naiagatsumashite

776
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,375
This guy is always scum

777
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,583
She was crying and whimpering.

778
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:07,416
I have no strength or guts

779
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:10,000
Help me, I have a dad, I have a dad, I have a dad

780
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,166
There is a father

781
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,500
I sprained my ankle.

782
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,833
Together with this scum

783
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,250
It's a sight to behold

784
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:19,750
Shit.

785
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,583
Jijihore Beach

786
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Grandpa

787
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,833
A little big

788
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:31,375
But with me

789
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,041
If you're with me

790
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,833
That's why

791
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:37,708
Probably not.

792
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:42,041
It's only natural that he should die.

793
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,166
You and your grandfather are dead.

794
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,416
And of course

795
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,041
Only one shoulder can be mastered.

796
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,791
I and Ichi were not there

797
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,416
All shoulders except

798
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:55,208
You did it!

799
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,125
So my grandpa is me

800
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,791
Together, we will fight the thunder

801
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,833
Breathing Spectator

802
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:04,000
I tried to

803
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,625
You said that

804
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,208
Denying it even by becoming a demon

805
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,458
I wanted to

806
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:21,250
Breath of Thunder, shoulder pain, everyone

807
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,708
In the blink of an eye

808
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:31,000
I managed to block five consecutive attacks.

809
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,500
Making a distinction between good and bad

810
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,625
It's gone now.

811
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,708
How can we distinguish between evil and evil?

812
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:42,000
You are the cause of the earthquake.

813
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I guess it's your favorite

814
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,250
Five consecutive attacks from Grandpa

815
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,541
What you received

816
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,458
I'll put it out quickly.

817
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:56,583
What's wrong? Is the battery running out?

818
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,750
It's okay, I

819
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,708
Try hitting it

820
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,208
hand

821
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,333
Thunder Breath

822
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
First Shoulder

823
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,500
Enemy Attack

824
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,416
Stupidly honest and straightforward

825
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,500
Just a poke

826
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The basic shoulder

827
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,875
Are you going to eat it?

828
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,291
Thunder Breath III

829
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:35,500
Shoulder width: 100cm

830
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,333
The first time while rotating

831
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,125
What happened to the attack?

832
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,125
Is it over already?

833
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,625
The third breath

834
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,958
Shoulder attack power generation

835
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,333
I haven't heard a single enemy attack.

836
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,500
Thunder Breathing Five Shoulders

837
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,708
The battle against the enemy has come to fruition.

838
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,166
It's my shoulder that's been evaluated

839
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,625
The sharpness cuts through skin and flesh

840
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,041
Crack open the drug and get rid of it

841
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,291
Rate me correctly

842
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:25,208
I accept that everything is low

843
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,166
What is not appreciated or acknowledged

844
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:30,375
I know it's bad, but this

845
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:33,000
It's my power

846
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,750
My own battle

847
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,500
Or eight-fold.

848
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,083
That's all you can do

849
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,166
But the viewer flew away

850
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:50,000
My expectations were wrong.

851
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
This is what you put out.

852
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,541
It's an individual

853
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,250
I knew it

854
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,291
I knew it

855
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,125
All one now

856
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,583
Thunder Breathing

857
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,250
Sixth Shoulder

858
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,583
All the attacks were darkened by the bullets.

859
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:26,875
Cracks in your body

860
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:29,125
Continue to see and feel

861
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:32,500
Burn my power into you, demon

862
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,166
Become God

863
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:35,291
Beyond the breath

864
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,250
I am special

865
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,666
Not like you

866
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,291
I'm not like you guys.

867
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,208
Jiji's prospects are as expected

868
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,833
It seems that was the difference

869
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,416
Looking at the injury

870
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:59,500
Lick like a brother

871
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,500
God's breath is the best

872
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,958
The shoulder is the basis of all shoulders

873
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:07,375
Use only the deaf shoulder

874
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:10,041
So in the end,

875
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,333
Other people were able to

876
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,750
By the way, the big deal

877
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,375
Hey, but still,

878
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:18,041
The coast is

879
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:20,333
That's right, there's something on your feet

880
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:21,083
I'll tell

881
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,500
You're gonna die soon anyway

882
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:28,791
What are you doing, you superior?

883
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:30,416
He hit someone from his class.

884
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,791
Don't cause trouble, you idiot.

885
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:35,958
There are people like you

886
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,708
It's really a matter of taste.

887
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,125
The coast knows me

888
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,625
I hated it enough.

889
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:44,500
I knew it.

890
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:46,958
I hate the beach too

891
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:50,625
But I respect it.

892
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:54,000
From the bottom of my heart,

893
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I was trying my best.

894
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,541
He was single-minded.

895
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm always yours

896
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I was looking at your back

897
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,375
You were special.

898
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,166
Grandpa and I

899
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:08,875
It's special for

900
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,291
He was an important person to me.

901
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:12,000
But

902
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,750
That's not enough

903
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,166
There was no such thing

904
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:19,125
I'm not happy with you at the moment.

905
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,333
There was a sound of

906
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:24,666
Put the happiness in your heart

907
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:27,250
There's a hole in the box

908
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,125
More and more happiness

909
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:30,791
Spilling out

910
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,500
I noticed the hole early

911
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,333
If it's not blocked, it won't be filled

912
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,166
It will never be

913
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Grandpa

914
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,208
Sorry, our path is

915
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,250
Divided

916
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:05,666
What is the remaining capacity?

917
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,708
sorry

918
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:37,833
Big Brother Thunder Breathing Room

919
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:52,708
This squid is another god

920
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,083
You didn't run away. What happened now?

921
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:10,000
My technique is too fast

922
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,125
What did you use?

923
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:13,833
Damn it

924
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,416
It was that child-pulling

925
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:19,416
What a bastard you are!

926
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:20,166
Just tell me

927
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,000
I didn't tell

928
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,625
different

929
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,666
Grandpa

930
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:27,666
He's not that kind of person.

931
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,500
This is mine

932
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:34,791
The one I thought of, just for me

933
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,250
With this technique

934
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,041
Someday with you

935
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,083
Shoulder to Shoulder

936
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,166
I wanted to fight

937
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,708
The seventh technique only has six shoulders.

938
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,541
7 from the missing Thunder Breath

939
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:57,625
The one who created the eyes

940
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,541
Only one type

941
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,000
Someone who can't use it

942
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:03,750
He took more than me.

943
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:07,625
Win but can't stand it

944
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:10,083
I can't stand it.

945
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:10,750
The fact is

946
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,000
Unacceptable

947
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,916
I'm such a guy

948
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,291
Am I going to lose?

949
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,791
I'm going crazy

950
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,583
no

951
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,750
No, it's not a loss.

952
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,208
Many will fall and die.

953
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,833
He has no strength left.

954
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,375
He's gonna die with me

955
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,875
What you can't give to people

956
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,958
Someday, someone will tell me

957
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:39,250
It's not impossible to get

958
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,083
The guy from Hori ended up doing nothing.

959
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:45,458
It's the same as not having it

960
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,583
Nothing by myself

961
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:48,541
Because I can't produce

962
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52,000
Dying Alone

963
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,625
That's the second one.

964
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:16,583
Here,

965
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,291
Jay-chan

966
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,375
Sorry, I'm friends with the beach.

967
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:32,916
I couldn't

968
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,833
I also wrote letters.

969
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,750
Reply

970
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:37,375
Please don't do it

971
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,875
If I wasn't here, the beach

972
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:41,791
I hope it doesn't turn out like that.

973
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:42,541
There may not have been

974
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,500
Forgive me for being a man and don't give me anything in return

975
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,750
I can't do it Jay

976
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,375
Chan is alive

977
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:52,541
There was a thundering sound on the pillars of my house.

978
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:53,125
I wanted to

979
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Sorry Jay

980
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,958
Sorry

981
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,166
She started to hate me

982
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,125
Say something

983
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:05,625
Jay-chan

984
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,500
It's filthy

985
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,916
This is tangled up in my legs

986
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,625
Jay-chan

987
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:18,875
This is ridiculous

988
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,583
Somehow everyone

989
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,291
You are my pride

990
01:00:37,000 --> 01:01:04,875
You, you, you

991
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:05,000
You you you you you you you you you you you you you you

992
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,458
You, you are noisy

993
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,333
Shut up, Murata Mitaka

994
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,500
Don't be attacked by money

995
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,750
Look around carefully

996
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,500
You!

997
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
What is the coast like?

998
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,208
If it were a person, it would be

999
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:18,958
I won't.

1000
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,041
I'm a demon, so I go to the beach

1001
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:22,958
Who knows?

1002
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,958
I use a blood thinner

1003
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,083
These scars and cracks on my face

1004
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,291
If it doesn't stop, eyeballs

1005
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:30,666
I'll avoid it until

1006
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,750
Can you hear me?

1007
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,000
Scary things for the weak

1008
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,500
Don't say that, and the blood poison too.

1009
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,125
I'm using it but the bleeding hasn't stopped.

1010
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:44,375
No, stop it!

1011
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:45,625
It's absolutely fine!

1012
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:46,750
I will definitely help!

1013
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,208
You're not gonna die!

1014
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:49,583
Good luck, Amesuma!

1015
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:50,500
keep it up!

1016
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:51,125
keep it up!

1017
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,083
The upper limit you were fighting at

1018
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,000
I still have my own skills and abilities.

1019
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,291
I couldn't use it properly.

1020
01:01:57,291 --> 01:02:01,958
Luckily there is one battle

1021
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,000
If it happened a year later, he would die instantly.

1022
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,833
That must have been the case.

1023
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,000
Email words

1024
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,375
Absolutely not!

1025
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,791
I did it wrong

1026
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:19,416
I didn't say that!

1027
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:25,000
What's that? You're yelling.

1028
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,041
The demon has come

1029
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:30,000
Nice window, hey!

1030
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,833
Hey!

1031
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:33,416
Did you say Yushirou?

1032
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,291
Agatsuma is

1033
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,250
I'll ask you to do it!

1034
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,583
Please kill him quickly

1035
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:42,916
Hey senpai!

1036
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:44,291
I learned that later!

1037
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:45,000
Fuck!

1038
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:48,916
Water Breathing,

1039
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:51,166
The second waterwheel!

1040
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,208
Is that a fish pond?

1041
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,500
Because it goes around

1042
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,791
Go that way!

1043
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:00,833
oh?

1044
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,000
Bad encounter

1045
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,583
No upper limit encountered

1046
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,750
The place where Muzan is is still

1047
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,666
Is it far away?

1048
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:27,583
Is everyone still safe?

1049
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:31,916
Shinobu

1050
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,125
I'm sure we'll win.

1051
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,125
surely

1052
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:39,375
Everyone is us

1053
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,708
What?

1054
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:44,708
This shaking is Kiyuu!

1055
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,500
stop!

1056
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,708
Calm down!

1057
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:51,333
Is someone fighting again?

1058
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,000
Someone else dies

1059
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,625
Will it happen?

1060
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:01,291
No, it's not.

1061
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,166
It's coming closer

1062
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,958
Ugh, this smell

1063
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,333
Up!

1064
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:19,125
30!

1065
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:19,500
More!

1066
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:25,541
How rude

1067
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:30,166
I'm glad I was alive.

1068
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,791
A weakling like you

1069
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,666
Umm, umm, Tanjiro!

1070
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,875
Yay!

1071
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:19,208
Probably the mayonnaise on this meat.

1072
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,750
Among things like

1073
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,375
Decomposing the drug that turns you back into a human

1074
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:24,458
They're probably breaking down the drug that turns them back into humans in the mayonnaise-like substance in the meat.

1075
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,000
Maybe the drug that turns them back into humans is being broken down in this meaty mayonnaise.

1076
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,958
I'm so sad.

1077
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,583
You are the only one

1078
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,958
We must not allow the village to be abandoned.

1079
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,541
And yet

1080
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,541
No matter what

1081
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,041
Gisul: Me too.

1082
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:47,833
Captured

1083
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,791
please

1084
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,875
Someone come quickly

1085
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:55,083
please!

1086
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:13,041
My father thinks so.

1087
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:17,458
If he dies, the other demons will die too.

1088
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:19,583
Then the spirit is splendid.

1089
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:20,500
Still alive

1090
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,791
The power of mercy is the Tama budget

1091
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:25,833
Suppressed by

1092
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:28,541
There must be something to suppress.

1093
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:30,125
I can't say that

1094
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:31,250
In Yushiro's eyes

1095
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,666
The cruel power of not reacting

1096
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:37,375
What will happen before the resurrection?

1097
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,291
Even if you defeat

1098
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,083
Must have

1099
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,625
But this

1100
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,000
In the infinite castle

1101
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,416
Truly a pitiful and tragic experience.

1102
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:50,125
Finding

1103
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:51,375
Is it possible?

1104
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,125
Don't rush

1105
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:01,416
You're doing well

1106
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,333
He always shows up

1107
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,750
At my place

1108
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:09,875
would have come too

1109
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,000
What is "Kibuddha and miserable"?

1110
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:23,250
That's the kind of guy he is.

1111
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,708
My father

1112
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,041
I will definitely accomplish it.

1113
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,458
Before our power runs out

1114
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:33,666
Find and settle

1115
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:34,541
If you don't add

1116
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,791
Stand up, we'll work hard

1117
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,958
The pillars are stretched out

1118
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,166
Stay in the grassland

1119
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,041
Please go ahead.

1120
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:58,833
Inoue Shiro, hurry up you guys

1121
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,333
Definitely beat the boss

1122
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:09,875
Please

1123
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,458
please

1124
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,875
I get it, this is you

1125
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:17,250
Leave it to us, Tokushima

1126
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,500
Damn it, Pillar Gamer

1127
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,416
Show the world

1128
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:32,583
Just what?

1129
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:33,625
thank you

1130
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,250
Father, everyone is stubborn.

1131
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,208
It's been stretched out

1132
01:08:49,541 --> 01:09:08,708
Father, I want to know about you guys.

1133
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,000
Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother

1134
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:19,333
Mother Mother Mother Mother Mother

1135
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:36,416
Mother Mother Mother Mother Mother

1136
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,916
MotherFatherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMotherMother

1137
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:54,458
Mother, I suffered because I had to protect you.

1138
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,958
It seems like

1139
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,875
I cooperated with my parents

1140
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:00,750
It's called Tamayo

1141
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,500
The medicine that the demon laid down

1142
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:05,541
I used it as instructed

1143
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:31,541
I can't see something I can't see something I can't see something I can't see something I can't see something I can't see something I can't see something

1144
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,916
Demons that don't disappear in sunlight

1145
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:39,666
In these long years

1146
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:42,250
Nezuko alone

1147
01:10:57,541 --> 01:11:01,541
The term "final stage"

1148
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:02,166
I have been

1149
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:04,166
It crosses my mind

1150
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:10,625
Every time that happened, my body trembled.

1151
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:12,375
Increased heart rate

1152
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:16,291
This long battle is tonight

1153
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:17,625
It may end

1154
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,416
I can't believe I'm there.

1155
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:23,208
To stand alive

1156
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:28,583
Feel it, you're the devil

1157
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,750
My sister who became

1158
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:30,916
From the time I brought you

1159
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:35,041
Something big is happening

1160
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,375
It started to spin.

1161
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,583
I feel like

1162
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:42,000
The images accumulated in the past battles

1163
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,250
What was created was a huge device

1164
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,208
If so, then you and

1165
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,000
Two types of "Nezuko"

1166
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,500
A small Haguruma

1167
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:53,416
I got hooked and now I can't

1168
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:54,958
The situation that was

1169
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:57,625
It started moving at once

1170
01:12:02,291 --> 01:12:03,875
Don't give up, Nezuko

1171
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,625
Don't give up, Tanjiro

1172
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,541
Don't lose to the whole

1173
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:16,000
It's a bloody hair horn, Kacchan!

1174
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:19,416
GO!

1175
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:19,875
GO!

1176
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:20,208
GO!

1177
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,375
I can't even cut my arm!

1178
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:22,541
I can't cut off his head!

1179
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:30,333
Disappeared

1180
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,208
Effective in attacking as well

1181
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:36,000
Aim for the neck that can fight

1182
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,916
No, but next

1183
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:42,000
The hair on the arm is now

1184
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:50,541
Arm hair cornersArm hair corners

1185
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:57,041
Arm hair angle arm

1186
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:58,500
Nokamikaze Tanjiro

1187
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,750
The skill is refined in the expansion

1188
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,708
It is being raised

1189
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,958
Your abilities are a pillar.

1190
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,083
It is no exaggeration to say that

1191
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,750
Not the upper limit of Sam

1192
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:18,750
I was so grateful to the other person that day.

1193
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:23,208
Despair in the trees, Kobe

1194
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:26,000
With tears dripping down my face, my sister

1195
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,291
The only way to save his life is to

1196
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:28,666
You who were not there

1197
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,708
Now I can fight

1198
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:43,666
Robbery of life and dignity

1199
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:44,750
To avoid being

1200
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,541
This boy is not weak.

1201
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:52,791
Don't insult me, Professor.

1202
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:54,416
The words were right.

1203
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:57,500
I'll admit it, you are

1204
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,375
It wasn't weak.

1205
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:01,208
Show your respect

1206
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,208
術式展開

1207
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:13,041
Let's get started

1208
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:16,208
It's time for Kakage

1209
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:27,541
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

1210
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:28,000
You, you, you

1211
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,916
You, you, you

1212
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:40,625
You, you, you

1213
01:14:49,541 --> 01:15:13,625
You, you, you

1214
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:15,541
You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you

1215
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:36,916
You

1216
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:41,500
You, you, you

1217
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:41,583
You you you you you you you you you you you

1218
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,458
You, you

1219
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:09,125
You, you, you

1220
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:09,250
You you you you you you you you you you you you you you

1221
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,500
You, you

1222
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,041
You, you, you

1223
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,208
You, you, you

1224
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:37,500
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

1225
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:53,625
You, you, you

1226
01:16:53,625 --> 01:17:02,708
You, you, you

1227
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:04,833
You, you, you

1228
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,208
You, you, you

1229
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:06,958
You, you, you

1230
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:07,125
You, you

1231
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,708
Your Queen

1232
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:17,125
Let's get started

1233
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:21,208
107 Yongsan Naval Port

1234
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:35,541
Geezer!

1235
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:39,583
Is that right?

1236
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:40,166
Geezer

1237
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:42,000
Is that the name?

1238
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:47,125
Kagura the Tree God!

1239
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:48,083
Destruction!

1240
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:49,916
Die!

1241
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,750
Let's become a shooter!

1242
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:55,833
Geezer!

1243
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,083
Good move!

1244
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:11,375
It's amazing how quickly this place has been built.

1245
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:12,333
I visited

1246
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:14,916
I'll give you a compliment!

1247
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,625
Even so, Professor

1248
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:18,875
You did a great job.

1249
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:22,833
That night I fell to the ground.

1250
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,083
You were waiting

1251
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:27,291
Only the overwhelmingly weak weeds

1252
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:30,291
No, but guess what!

1253
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:33,541
You are amazing now

1254
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:36,208
Growth, I am pure

1255
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,916
My happy heart is dancing!

1256
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:43,583
Professor that night

1257
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:44,958
I'm glad I died

1258
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,916
If you think about it, it's even better than that.

1259
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,041
I couldn't become stronger

1260
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:53,958
A human who may be

1261
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:55,500
It's nonsense that

1262
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,291
Values

1263
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:57,375
I had it.

1264
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:00,416
What?

1265
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:11,625
You, shut up now

1266
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:16,416
Mr. Hayashiki

1267
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:17,500
Don't talk!

1268
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,708
Why am I being invited away?

1269
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,125
There you are

1270
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:27,083
And Professor Otoko is different too.

1271
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,375
You are immature

1272
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,458
Just spitting out the grains

1273
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:31,541
I'm just here for anyone

1274
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:33,916
Or to anyone

1275
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:38,500
It was a misunderstanding, I'm just a idiot.

1276
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,833
What I hate is the weak.

1277
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:44,833
I spit out the grains

1278
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:45,875
Only the weak can make calls

1279
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:51,208
Only for weaklings

1280
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:52,291
There is a ignore diagram

1281
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,541
Running Equality

1282
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,791
What is ejected is natural

1283
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,541
Nothing but a cut

1284
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:03,333
What you're saying

1285
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:04,375
It's all wrong.

1286
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,875
You are there now

1287
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,208
That's the proof.

1288
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,208
At birth, everyone

1289
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,500
A weak baby, to someone

1290
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,291
I need help.

1291
01:20:18,291 --> 01:20:20,666
You can't live either

1292
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:21,458
That's right baby

1293
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:24,625
Maybe I don't remember

1294
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:26,541
But when I was a baby

1295
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:28,416
You are being protected by someone

1296
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,583
Now I'm saved

1297
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:31,750
I'm alive

1298
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,916
The strong help the weak

1299
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:41,458
Protect and the weak are strong

1300
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:43,166
Also, I'm more

1301
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:46,291
Helping and protecting the weak

1302
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:50,416
But it's natural that I'm a baby.

1303
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:52,000
I forgive your way of thinking.

1304
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
No more of yours

1305
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,125
I won't let you like me

1306
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:02,958
got it

1307
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,916
I put this in the center of my body.

1308
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:10,833
So I don't accept it.

1309
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,666
Even though I've become stronger, I'm still deep

1310
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:14,625
The feeling won't go away

1311
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,375
Whatever you do

1312
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,958
At first, everyone is impressed

1313
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:26,708
With help from those around me

1314
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:30,000
I'm the one who remembers others

1315
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,041
I'm comparing the two live.

1316
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:33,083
No, it's an opponent

1317
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:35,041
is always yourself

1318
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:38,541
What's important is who you were yesterday

1319
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:40,458
It's about becoming stronger

1320
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:43,875
This continues for 10 or 20 years.

1321
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:45,875
If we can do that, it will be a great

1322
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:48,125
And now

1323
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,041
You are a person

1324
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,041
I'll shine a light on you

1325
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:00,000
What?

1326
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,291
In the middle of nowhere

1327
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,500
I shook it off.

1328
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,916
Simple

1329
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:13,125
You are deep after all

1330
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:19,375
The biggest war in the early stages of development

1331
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:25,500
It's too early.

1332
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:27,416
Rather than looking fast, this

1333
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:30,041
This feeling, this personality

1334
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:37,083
This is a re-kill

1335
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:38,750
I was expecting

1336
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:43,083
Quick Loot

1337
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:50,833
Several times, the action was previewed.

1338
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:51,958
Even if you can withstand the attack

1339
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,750
Too much power and no compensation

1340
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:56,000
The personality that can't reduce it to zero

1341
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,208
A safe rush of moves

1342
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,125
As sure as possible

1343
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:01,208
Let me shove it.

1344
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,833
Towards the rapidity of the body

1345
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:06,583
The incoming attack is absorbed into the self-fire area.

1346
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:07,250
It has been sent

1347
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,000
It's like, what?

1348
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:10,375
What is it?

1349
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,750
What does it react to and attract?

1350
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,416
You can do it.

1351
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,583
You think first

1352
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:18,500
It was something

1353
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:21,041
The past of Akatan Kendo

1354
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,500
If you smoke

1355
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:27,041
Wide-screen camera

1356
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:29,000
Put on Keen

1357
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:42,916
It's an interesting technique.

1358
01:23:42,916 --> 01:23:44,166
The feeling of being worried grew

1359
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:46,291
What does it look like?

1360
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:48,541
Did you swing it that way?

1361
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,625
The shoreline sways like a shadow child.

1362
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:56,250
That's interesting.

1363
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:06,750
Wooden Hair Kagura Pencil

1364
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:10,458
Damn

1365
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:12,250
Come

1366
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:21,208
Separate each other

1367
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,125
Let go let go

1368
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:28,458
No, I won't let go

1369
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:41,416
Barely

1370
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:49,083
I'm so mad

1371
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:51,500
My back hurts without doing anything.

1372
01:24:52,041 --> 01:24:53,541
How far can you fly?

1373
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:55,000
Thank you for that.

1374
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,625
Upper limit sushi

1375
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:03,125
I really want to pull out my sword.

1376
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:05,583
No, it doesn't matter who it is

1377
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:06,875
A match like five losses

1378
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:08,458
I don't like to do it either

1379
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:13,125
But now I am overwhelmed.

1380
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,375
With a strong man for the first time in a while

1381
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,750
The feeling was immediate after meeting

1382
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,791
Sharply entangled

1383
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:18,666
I realized that

1384
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:22,250
The closed sensation hits

1385
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,416
Being pulled up and dragged

1386
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,583
To the place where the strong stand

1387
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:29,041
Barely alive

1388
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,458
The thing called a deal

1389
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:33,000
How much of a person's ability

1390
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,625
I understood how to stretch

1391
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:40,708
Barely

1392
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:55,125
Barely

1393
01:25:58,791 --> 01:25:59,541
Asakawa Discovery

1394
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:02,208
That thing went up

1395
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:08,333
Zamaton Breathes Water

1396
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,000
Let's shoot the other one.

1397
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:13,000
Key Head

1398
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:17,083
Barely

1399
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:19,875
Just barely

1400
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:26,708
Both are just barely early.

1401
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:28,375
But Girigiri-san

1402
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:30,250
The increased speed immediately turned red

1403
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,416
Sa is a pure idol

1404
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:32,750
Barely

1405
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:35,333
Your power is

1406
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:36,083
Is that outrageous?

1407
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,958
Just barely

1408
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:42,958
Barely

1409
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:46,416
More

1410
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:48,500
Shoot me some more

1411
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,041
Barely watery shoulders and buttocks

1412
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:41,250
Point water shoulder water shoulder water bottom water no

1413
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:45,958
Point destruction dance gya

1414
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:57,916
It's barely red.

1415
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,625
Calm down

1416
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:08,833
Think about it, don't rush, absolutely

1417
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:10,083
Don't abandon enforcement

1418
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,208
Why is it so red?

1419
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:14,125
The attack is magnetic

1420
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:15,791
How accurate is it?

1421
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,416
Attacking from behind or from the corners

1422
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:20,583
Why do we always react to

1423
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,958
Think

1424
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:29,333
The head and legs are trained

1425
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:30,875
The current enforcement

1426
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:32,666
Close to the region of

1427
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:38,333
Red in the fight against United Nations

1428
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,333
The head and legs

1429
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:40,500
I used the word

1430
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,625
What is a head and foot? I smell

1431
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:46,541
Various things

1432
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:48,750
Redness so you can feel it

1433
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:49,625
Something with the head and legs

1434
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:50,708
I feel

1435
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:07,625
The enemy made just the slightest advance.

1436
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:09,125
The target is

1437
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:10,791
So Inotsuki

1438
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:11,833
Gyutaro's attack

1439
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,541
I noticed you behind me.

1440
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:14,000
It was from

1441
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,750
But it's amazing

1442
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:19,416
I have a strong body skin.

1443
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:21,541
From behind.

1444
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:23,125
But someone is watching me

1445
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:24,541
Hey, I know you're watching.

1446
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:25,708
Give it a try

1447
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:29,791
Let me do it.

1448
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:35,541
Look at your right shoulder

1449
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:37,208
What a win!

1450
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:39,958
Look into the distance

1451
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,375
The one who comes is a one shot

1452
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,708
I understand, but I don't understand

1453
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:45,333
It's so fast

1454
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,666
Just now, I was touching the skin of my body.

1455
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:48,208
Sagusa stinger

1456
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:49,666
Here it comes

1457
01:29:50,916 --> 01:29:53,000
That's right, the moon in the well is also melted and piled up.

1458
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
The sensation of touching your skin

1459
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,916
What is invisible to

1460
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:59,666
What happened after that?

1461
01:29:59,666 --> 01:30:00,500
I talked about

1462
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:02,375
At that time

1463
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:06,250
However, on the other hand,

1464
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:07,708
I realized that he was a man without a time limit.

1465
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:08,791
It can be difficult.

1466
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:11,375
That little papa

1467
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:14,000
The mouth of a flower

1468
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:14,791
The pabber at home

1469
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:16,083
It was scary.

1470
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:18,708
Before you know it

1471
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:22,625
Grab a handful of rice and

1472
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:23,916
I was sitting in the back

1473
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:26,625
Don't say pabar

1474
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,250
No, grandma.

1475
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,208
Pabba-san, caller, me

1476
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:33,375
I thought so just now.

1477
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:34,916
If you approach without noticing

1478
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:36,708
Then kill him.

1479
01:30:36,708 --> 01:30:38,500
If you don't have one, don't have one.

1480
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:42,708
But that's Grandma

1481
01:30:42,708 --> 01:30:43,833
I feel sorry for the moon

1482
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:44,458
I want to add

1483
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:45,416
Because there wasn't

1484
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,875
Without bringing up the previous demon

1485
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:48,416
To defeat

1486
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:50,375
I don't think it's possible

1487
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:54,833
Well, that's true.

1488
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,166
Not the same as before

1489
01:30:56,166 --> 01:30:58,083
It's a blow to the gut.

1490
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,166
The head of the family is

1491
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:00,333
It's beautiful.

1492
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:03,208
Trivial conversation

1493
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,500
But I was sure of something.

1494
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:05,875
On

1495
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,333
I feel like

1496
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:12,125
The Chinese character for redness

1497
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:14,291
What is a scalp that

1498
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Is it different from before?

1499
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,750
Willingness to try

1500
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,541
Time or amount

1501
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:24,041
With my scent

1502
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:25,125
Something like a mover

1503
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:28,458
The Battle of Red

1504
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:30,458
How to make it crazy

1505
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:42,291
Kaoshi's hair

1506
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:47,250
Video Zaraki

1507
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,583
That's right, Tanjiro

1508
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:53,666
yes

1509
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:10,541
Exciting

1510
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:14,916
Bankan Chi just now impossible

1511
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:20,250
The realm of thought, huh?

1512
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:22,958
That's it

1513
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:35,083
Ohohoe

1514
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:43,125
Look, my dad has sunburn

1515
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:44,625
What happens when you dance the Kagura?

1516
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,750
I'm thinking

1517
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:47,916
If Dad is in pain

1518
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:49,458
If so, I'll be the one next year.

1519
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,041
Dad's body will change

1520
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:55,291
Thank you I'm worried

1521
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,541
Even though I'm just kidding, my father

1522
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:00,541
In recent years, Kagura

1523
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:00,958
tough

1524
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:02,250
I have never thought

1525
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:05,208
It's a strange thing.

1526
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,958
Grandpa Kagura

1527
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:08,708
When I first learned

1528
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:12,041
Younger, healthier and stronger

1529
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:14,250
I couldn't even hold my breath

1530
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:14,375
sea bream

1531
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:15,708
It was painful to become

1532
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:22,500
Once a year at the beginning of the year

1533
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,541
The sickle has been gone for many generations.

1534
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:26,958
Kitakagura starts from sunset

1535
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:28,500
Until dawn

1536
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,750
Continuing hardship

1537
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:30,708
It was something like that.

1538
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:33,708
There are a total of 12 dance styles

1539
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:37,208
Hundreds and thousands of

1540
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:39,000
Repeat a thousand times

1541
01:33:42,333 --> 01:33:44,125
30 people wasted movement

1542
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:44,875
There were a lot

1543
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:48,000
The last thing I want to do is

1544
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,333
Correct breathing and correct

1545
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,541
Movement: First movement

1546
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,416
exert maximum force

1547
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:57,583
So what?

1548
01:33:57,583 --> 01:34:00,666
My mind is gradually becoming clearer

1549
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:02,208
It becomes

1550
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:04,083
transparent?

1551
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:08,208
I can't remember at first.

1552
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:09,875
The movements that must be made

1553
01:34:09,875 --> 01:34:11,291
Don't pick up the feeling

1554
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:12,500
must

1555
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:16,208
Open the compatibility of your body

1556
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:18,541
Recognizing the shape of each individual blood vessel

1557
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:24,875
This time is really painful

1558
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:27,416
Continue struggling like this

1559
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:29,000
I'm stuck in a dead end

1560
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,291
I can only imagine that

1561
01:34:30,291 --> 01:34:33,208
I remember a lot of things

1562
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:35,666
After absorption, it is necessary

1563
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:38,208
Suck away what is not there

1564
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:40,041
What is needed for the movement

1565
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:41,166
Just leave

1566
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:46,500
Close close?

1567
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:47,541
When people try to listen carefully, people try to listen carefully.

1568
01:34:47,541 --> 01:34:50,166
Close your eyes when

1569
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:52,875
That's how it is.

1570
01:34:52,875 --> 01:34:55,791
What is most needed at that moment

1571
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:57,041
Choose something

1572
01:34:57,041 --> 01:35:00,833
It's coming, soon all over my body

1573
01:35:00,833 --> 01:35:02,708
Opening of blood vessels and muscles

1574
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:04,750
Blink Close

1575
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,875
So quick and easy

1576
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:07,958
Be able to

1577
01:35:10,291 --> 01:35:12,500
At that moment, light appeared.

1578
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,250
The way to stab opens

1579
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:18,250
Inside my head, inside my head

1580
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,583
The world becomes clear when you

1581
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:23,625
But

1582
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:25,750
This is as much as we can

1583
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:27,083
Because I suffered

1584
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:30,666
I have finally reached that realm

1585
01:35:30,666 --> 01:35:31,458
Can I go there?

1586
01:35:32,541 --> 01:35:35,375
Continue your efforts without saying too much.

1587
01:35:35,375 --> 01:35:38,416
Banana Hollow

1588
01:35:38,416 --> 01:35:39,750
Thank you

1589
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:46,500
10 days before my father died

1590
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:48,875
Bears attack and eat people

1591
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:50,208
One incident

1592
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,541
It happened on the mountain over there

1593
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,375
Spread the sun around the house

1594
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:56,625
The name with the lines is

1595
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:57,625
It was spread all over

1596
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:18,041
Short life

1597
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:23,083
yes

1598
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:27,416
Follow me

1599
01:36:45,541 --> 01:37:02,208
Yep, see?

1600
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:17,083
The one who is hungry is

1601
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:19,208
I'm sorry, but more than that

1602
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:20,125
Come here

1603
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,083
I will not tolerate

1604
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:24,500
I feel good about my family.

1605
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,916
How many people are there?

1606
01:37:26,916 --> 01:37:28,291
I will not tolerate delinquency.

1607
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:31,708
If you don't listen to the warning

1608
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:35,875
Taking a life

1609
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:36,875
It is intended to

1610
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:50,791
As thick as a human torso

1611
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:53,041
The bear has a bell around its neck.

1612
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:54,041
With the roots

1613
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:55,375
It fell with a thud

1614
01:37:57,708 --> 01:37:58,750
I couldn't follow it with my eyes

1615
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:01,583
But maybe my father is a mabataki

1616
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:02,458
Twice during

1617
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:05,458
I think it was cut

1618
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,541
Otherwise, that

1619
01:38:08,541 --> 01:38:09,875
Cut off the head with the width of an axe

1620
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:10,666
It is impossible

1621
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,500
My father's scent doesn't waver at all

1622
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,958
The bear's neck was missing.

1623
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:18,250
No fear before or after cutting

1624
01:38:18,916 --> 01:38:19,958
Without lunch

1625
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:22,250
I haven't released it yet

1626
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:31,291
Did you see it properly?

1627
01:38:32,875 --> 01:38:34,833
Don't forget what you just saw

1628
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:39,916
My father used his power

1629
01:38:39,916 --> 01:38:41,000
Mischievously alluring

1630
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:41,708
Not a person

1631
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,166
I realized later

1632
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:47,750
That is a show of talent.

1633
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:48,875
He let me

1634
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:51,416
I can see the transparent world

1635
01:38:51,416 --> 01:38:52,750
From my father's great judgment

1636
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:54,625
So that I can learn

1637
01:38:57,625 --> 01:38:59,333
My dad and my grandpa

1638
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:01,666
And Grandpa Hinomi

1639
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:03,500
Surely the same

1640
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:09,458
Never give up

1641
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:12,500
Keep going, no matter what obstacles

1642
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:13,250
Someday

1643
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:16,541
Overcoming it with the efforts of many horses

1644
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:20,958
I know, Dad.

1645
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:23,666
So that time, the redness

1646
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,250
Those late afternoons

1647
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:26,416
exchanged blows.

1648
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:32,291
Maybe that blow was mine.

1649
01:39:32,291 --> 01:39:33,291
Complete life

1650
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:34,500
It was something to be stolen.

1651
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:36,666
Change with Giwoo

1652
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:38,875
A change of technique

1653
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:41,125
Rapidly gaining recognition

1654
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:42,250
From a blow like that

1655
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:43,166
Please protect me.

1656
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:45,708
But at that moment

1657
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:47,291
Even Giu-san can be in between.

1658
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:47,708
Didn't fit

1659
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:51,750
But maybe it's impossible

1660
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,458
I couldn't do it at that time.

1661
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:54,458
For some reason I didn't think

1662
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:57,416
I only felt it for a moment

1663
01:39:57,416 --> 01:39:59,583
I put it in for just a moment.

1664
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:02,458
That World

1665
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:08,791
A world that penetrates

1666
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:14,666
The body seemed to penetrate

1667
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:18,000
Hantenkyuu in my heart

1668
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,750
When I was hiding

1669
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:19,750
was the same

1670
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:22,000
Did you see it or did you buy it?

1671
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:22,541
I don't know

1672
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:30,625
Focus only on the meeting

1673
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:32,125
And the other senses were closed.

1674
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:35,166
I still can't win

1675
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:36,166
It moved quickly

1676
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:39,750
My dad taught me that.

1677
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,041
I entered a world that penetrates

1678
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:43,375
Time prediction and attack

1679
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:45,250
Speed increases exponentially

1680
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,916
The movement of the opponent's blood vessels

1681
01:40:49,916 --> 01:40:50,833
Flow and contraction

1682
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:51,416
See through

1683
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,083
The contraction of your own muscles

1684
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:56,208
Faster

1685
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:57,500
I knew the name

1686
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:03,041
Red is probably simply

1687
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:05,083
Headphones closed

1688
01:41:05,083 --> 01:41:06,791
Aim for the neck with

1689
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:08,125
Might be

1690
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:21,833
Figure it out

1691
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:24,166
Figure it out

1692
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:29,083
Now all the water is gone.

1693
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,166
It seems like you've given it your all. Enough already. Let's end it here.

1694
01:41:30,166 --> 01:41:43,750
I was brought in and got off

1695
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:49,125
I'll put it down, I won't avoid it

1696
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:51,708
Punching

1697
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:53,875
moreover

1698
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:25,625
End attack mid-arm

1699
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:26,750
What does it mean to cut it off and stop it?

1700
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:28,583
The sound of breathing

1701
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:31,041
Maybe not.

1702
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,083
Simply saved

1703
01:42:36,458 --> 01:42:39,041
All the cells in the body are born

1704
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:41,166
Right now,

1705
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:42,666
He is telling me to kill

1706
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:46,208
This guy has some

1707
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:47,708
A change has occurred

1708
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:50,625
It's dangerous

1709
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:53,458
He simply

1710
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,250
Concentrated

1711
01:42:55,625 --> 01:42:56,291

Also, the speed of the attack

1715
01:43:12,125 --> 01:43:14,166
The rising power is increasing

1716
01:43:14,166 --> 01:43:17,875

no

1721
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,500
Movement slows down

1722
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,541
Can you see it?

1723
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:15,250
It's deep

1724
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,000
I saw 200 shots almost at the same time.

1725
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,041
Even with the strike, everything is in vain

1726
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:23,166

Even an attack will destroy me.

1735
01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:27,166
Shin is the one who feels

1736
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:28,833
The stronger the fighting, the stronger

1737
01:45:28,833 --> 01:45:30,166

1738

1739

What is this strange thing?

1740
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,500
There is something else going on

1741
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,125
It seems to have become a living thing

1742
01:45:44,125 --> 01:45:47,458
This guy has stopped moving.

1743
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:48,166
Uh, there's no movement.

It's a sturdy one.

1802
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I threw so much into the battle

1803
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,833
And without any anti-nationalism,

1804
01:59:45,833 --> 01:59:46,916
To wake up.

1805
01:59:47,875 --> 01:59:49,333
In combat, I am lightly constructed.

1806
01:59:49,708 --> 01:59:51,166
Soryuu, a stalk

1807
01:59:51,166 --> 01:59:52,750
A martial arts comrade who fights in

1808
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:53,458
Are they doing it?

1809
01:59:54,583 --> 01:59:55,875
One Kado family member

01:59:57,833 --> 01:59:58,666

1812
01:59:58,666 --> 02:00:00,500
By doing this, Hidehime was brought home

1813
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,083
It is made.

1814
02:00:04,291 --> 02:00:05,708
I want you to do it first.

1815
02:00:05,708 --> 02:00:06,916
What hurts is,

1816
02:00:06,916 --> 02:00:09,625
It's the Second Hand Girl's official illness.

1817
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:10,750
I have a job

1818
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:13,125
So, I want to leave it to you.

1819
02:00:14,166 --> 02:00:15,708
The other day, my wife was diagnosed with government disease.

1820
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:17,166
So he committed suicide by gunfire.

1821
02:00:17,166 --> 02:00:20,041
It's so hard.

1822
02:00:20,041 --> 02:00:21,833
This is it.

1823
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:27,125
I am truly harmless.

1824
02:00:27,125 --> 02:00:29,541
Because of this, my wife and daughter

1825
02:00:29,541 --> 02:00:32,416
To cause trouble.

1826
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:36,416
A wealthy man in a house with only one daughter

1827
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:36,833
Put me

1828
02:00:36,833 --> 02:00:38,791
Is it okay to be there?

1829
02:00:40,541 --> 02:00:42,625
You, the wealthy man, are in the Sengoku period.

1830
02:00:42,625 --> 02:00:43,791
I want to beat you up

1831
02:00:43,791 --> 02:00:45,000
Because I put it on.

1832
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,208
It's okay.

1833
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:53,291
They look similar.

1834
02:00:58,791 --> 02:01:01,666
I see.

1835
02:01:02,083 --> 02:01:03,666
You're so uncomfortable

1836
02:01:03,666 --> 02:01:05,750
It was like this

1837
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,583
Get rid of your boring past

1838
02:01:07,583 --> 02:01:08,000
to make

1839
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,458
That's what it was.

1840
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:17,166
This is my daughter, Koyuki.

1841
02:01:20,166 --> 02:01:22,791
A stupid past.

1842
02:01:25,916 --> 02:01:28,250
Stupid.

1843
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:35,541
Sorry, Shiroshi.

1844
02:01:36,583 --> 02:01:43,000
What do you think, Koyuki?

1845
02:01:45,083 --> 02:01:46,208
Is it okay to wake up?

1846
02:01:49,625 --> 02:01:51,291
She's definitely cuter than in the morning

1847
02:01:51,291 --> 02:01:52,625
It's getting better.

1848
02:01:52,708 --> 02:01:56,000
Maybe it's a little better.

1849
02:01:57,625 --> 02:02:00,041
Ah, this one.

1850
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:02,458
No matter how many times I ask, he never says his name.

1851
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:07,458
Hey, don't tell anyone.

1852
02:02:09,166 --> 02:02:10,708
Sit here.

1853
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:13,500
Well, until I get back.

1854
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,125
Ask

1855
02:02:14,125 --> 02:02:16,416
Leave it there.

1856
02:02:16,416 --> 02:02:21,250
Umm... face...

1857
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:34,458
Is your hair okay?

1858
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:41,041
I'm sure it will heal.

1859
02:02:41,041 --> 02:02:43,791
Help, protect.

1860
02:02:44,916 --> 02:02:47,541
My life is an adventure

1861
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:49,041
Just a mess

1862
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:50,333
Stupid

1863
02:02:50,333 --> 02:02:51,583
It was something like that.

1864
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:09,833
thank you.

1865
02:03:11,375 --> 02:03:12,416
Don't tell me every single thing

1866
02:03:12,416 --> 02:03:13,750
That's fine.

1867
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:14,833
Sleep without worrying

1868
02:03:14,833 --> 02:03:16,625
Please.

1869
02:03:16,625 --> 02:03:19,666
sorry.

1870
02:03:19,666 --> 02:03:21,333
Sorry for the trouble.

1871
02:03:21,333 --> 02:03:21,458
That's fine.

1872
02:03:21,458 --> 02:03:32,333
Should we close this place? It's fine as it is.

1873
02:03:34,666 --> 02:03:35,791
Koyuki is really

1874
02:03:35,791 --> 02:03:37,708
I was weak.

1875
02:03:38,833 --> 02:03:40,625
All night long,

1876
02:03:41,125 --> 02:03:42,583
A towel to help those affected by the disaster

1877
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:43,833
Hey, change your pajamas.

1878
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:46,000
Or drink water to the beans.

1879
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,458
Of course, I had to carry him when we went to Kawaya.

1880
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:48,666
Koyuki was really weak. When we went to Kawaya,

1881
02:03:48,666 --> 02:03:50,416
Of course I have to carry it.

1882
02:03:50,416 --> 02:03:52,041
It had to be.

1883
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:57,500
Originally, I was my father’s

1884
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:59,416
I was sick with a government illness.

1885
02:03:59,541 --> 02:04:01,083
Extraordinary heart

1886
02:04:01,083 --> 02:04:02,958
Because my body was able to function,

1887
02:04:03,083 --> 02:04:05,625
It's not very spicy.

1888
02:04:10,166 --> 02:04:12,000
I'm always sorry.

1889
02:04:19,125 --> 02:04:21,500
People who suffer from illness,

1890
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:23,375
Why always apologize?

1891
02:04:24,958 --> 02:04:25,833
Taking the time to

1892
02:04:25,833 --> 02:04:27,416
I'm sorry.

1893
02:04:27,708 --> 02:04:29,083
The coughing is loud

1894
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

1895
02:04:31,125 --> 02:04:32,541
Unable to work satisfactorily

1896
02:04:32,541 --> 02:04:36,375
I'm sorry.

1897
02:04:36,375 --> 02:04:37,708
Take care of yourself

1898
02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:39,333
I would like to.

1899
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:40,208
My cough won't stop

1900
02:04:40,208 --> 02:04:41,416
It doesn't exist.

1901
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:42,708
If you can breathe normally

1902
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:44,500
I would like to.

1903
02:04:44,916 --> 02:04:47,541
The most painful thing is the person

1904
02:04:47,541 --> 02:04:49,208
But it should be.

1905
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:54,666
I'm always sorry.

1906
02:04:55,041 --> 02:04:57,541
Because of me, the single

1907
02:04:57,541 --> 02:04:59,166
I can't,

1908
02:04:59,583 --> 02:05:01,583
I can't even go play.

1909
02:05:02,458 --> 02:05:03,291
I want to play

1910
02:05:03,291 --> 02:05:04,541
I don't think so.

1911
02:05:04,541 --> 02:05:06,458
Since long ago.

1912
02:05:06,875 --> 02:05:08,291
Around the time we met

1913
02:05:08,291 --> 02:05:09,750
Since I'm doing a single bet,

1914
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:10,750
Do not do so.

1915
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:15,958
But sometimes I feel

1916
02:05:15,958 --> 02:05:19,625
Tonight there will be fireworks to celebrate the change

1917
02:05:19,625 --> 02:05:21,291
Because it seems to be rising,

1918
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:23,958
Go ahead.

1919
02:05:25,041 --> 02:05:26,791
I agree.

1920
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:27,625
Eyes and eyebrows converge

1921
02:05:27,625 --> 02:05:29,083
If you wait,

1922
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:30,750
Carrying it on my back, to the front of the bridge

1923
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:35,500
Shall we go?

1924
02:05:37,666 --> 02:05:39,333
If you can't go today,

1925
02:05:39,666 --> 02:05:41,500
Next year too, the fireworks will

1926
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:43,500
It will rise, so go at that time.

1927
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,333
That's fine.

1928
02:05:53,666 --> 02:05:55,583
The only troublesome thing about government illnesses

1929
02:05:55,583 --> 02:05:58,041
I thought so because of the conversation

1930
02:05:58,041 --> 02:06:00,375
On the way, light snow started falling

1931
02:06:00,375 --> 02:06:01,000
Wake up

1932
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,333
It was crying.

1933
02:06:03,333 --> 02:06:04,958
I'm in a sickbed

1934
02:06:04,958 --> 02:06:06,875
Maybe, but it's not bad.

1935
02:06:06,875 --> 02:06:07,791
When I get it, I can't help it

1936
02:06:07,791 --> 02:06:14,250
To become unkind.

1937
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:27,208
I see.

1938
02:06:27,583 --> 02:06:29,541
Is this the white in Shiroji?

1939
02:06:29,666 --> 02:06:31,583
Is that a pony?

1940
02:06:31,625 --> 02:06:33,000
I see.

1941
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,875
You are definitely

1942
02:06:33,875 --> 02:06:35,041
Just like me.

1943
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:37,125
If there's nothing to protect

1944
02:06:37,125 --> 02:06:38,583
It's no good.

1945
02:06:38,833 --> 02:06:40,833
A child protecting his mother

1946
02:06:40,833 --> 02:06:42,625
That's something like that.

1947
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:49,458
Not a samurai or anything, just a commercial product

1948
02:06:49,458 --> 02:06:51,541
But with such a large amount of land

1949
02:06:51,541 --> 02:06:52,750
Has soil

1950
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:55,583
The old man was attacked by the mountain tribe.

1951
02:06:55,583 --> 02:06:56,833
I helped him out of his misery.

1952
02:06:56,833 --> 02:06:59,166
However, the old man

1953
02:06:59,166 --> 02:07:00,708
I was deeply moved by Ryu's technique.

1954
02:07:00,708 --> 02:07:02,291
And, soon

1955
02:07:02,291 --> 02:07:04,000
The land of the past and the old

1956
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,583
The soil was sold commercially.

1957
02:07:05,583 --> 02:07:07,166
Apparently so.

1958
02:07:09,958 --> 02:07:12,000
But the land and

1959
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,500
The soil is ours

1960
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:14,708
Those who wanted to

1961
02:07:14,708 --> 02:07:16,708
It's not interesting.

1962
02:07:16,708 --> 02:07:19,041
The sword-fighting ground that was established was

1963
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:20,000
In soluble soil

1964
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
They were harassing me.

1965
02:07:23,583 --> 02:07:25,375
Because of that, Soryu

1966
02:07:25,375 --> 02:07:26,666
Soil has cultural value

1967
02:07:26,666 --> 02:07:28,166
did not increase.

1968
02:07:35,541 --> 02:07:38,125
However, the training here

1969
02:07:38,125 --> 02:07:40,416
Koyuki's official illness,

1970
02:07:41,625 --> 02:07:45,291
My heart was saved.

1971
02:08:04,166 --> 02:08:05,916
Three years later, I

1972
02:08:05,916 --> 02:08:07,875
turned 18.

1973
02:08:08,958 --> 02:08:11,708
Koyuki is 16 and can be a bit flustered.

1974
02:08:11,708 --> 02:08:13,291
Almost gone,

1975
02:08:13,666 --> 02:08:14,750
To be able to live normally

1976
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:17,416
It had become.

1977
02:08:20,666 --> 02:08:22,000
White background, right?

1978
02:08:23,625 --> 02:08:25,416
yes.

1979
02:08:26,375 --> 02:08:28,708
You see, this soil

1980
02:08:28,708 --> 02:08:29,208
Follow

1981
02:08:29,208 --> 02:08:29,458
Or white background?

1982
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:32,333
Hey, Shiroji, you too, Koyuki.

1983
02:08:32,333 --> 02:08:33,416
I like

1984
02:08:33,416 --> 02:08:35,000
That's what I'm saying.

1985
02:08:36,083 --> 02:08:36,208
teeth?

1986
02:08:44,791 --> 02:08:46,000
The financial statement has already been submitted

1987
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,416
My future is in

1988
02:08:47,416 --> 02:08:49,666
What a good imagination!

1989
02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:51,666
I couldn't.

1990
02:08:52,791 --> 02:08:54,750
And what's more, someone

1991
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:55,916
Follow that self

1992
02:08:55,916 --> 02:08:56,625
A future that gives

1993
02:08:56,625 --> 02:08:58,875
What, even better.

1994
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:02,958
Maybe I,

1995
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:04,125
My dad said

1996
02:09:04,125 --> 02:09:05,791
So, from now on

1997
02:09:05,791 --> 02:09:07,083
The right way to live

1998
02:09:07,083 --> 02:09:07,875
Can it be done?

1999
02:09:09,875 --> 02:09:11,416
You can start your life over

2000
02:09:11,416 --> 02:09:12,416
It may be

2001
02:09:12,416 --> 02:09:15,208
A faint hope, but a collection

2002
02:09:15,208 --> 02:09:15,791
As much as

2003
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:17,458
It swells up big.

2004
02:09:24,333 --> 02:09:27,583
At this time, I was in awe of my life.

2005
02:09:27,583 --> 02:09:28,583
I want to protect it no matter what

2006
02:09:28,583 --> 02:09:30,666
The two people who thought that were killed

2007
02:09:30,666 --> 02:09:31,416
etc.

2008
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:35,750
I never dreamed it would happen.

2009
02:09:40,083 --> 02:09:41,083
Visit the grave

2010
02:09:41,083 --> 02:09:44,041
It was my dad's.

2011
02:09:44,125 --> 02:09:44,458
Report that the collection limit will be increased

2012
02:09:44,458 --> 02:09:57,291
I want to, and the sun sets

2013
02:09:57,291 --> 02:09:58,500
Before, I had sympathy.

2014
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,583
Even though I returned,

2015
02:10:04,041 --> 02:10:05,125
I vomited before I even heard it.

2016
02:10:05,125 --> 02:10:06,833
it was.

2017
02:10:07,416 --> 02:10:10,208
The large curtain is light and I don't like it.

2018
02:10:10,208 --> 02:10:11,583
I get goosebumps at this premonition

2019
02:10:11,583 --> 02:10:12,458
was standing there.

2020
02:10:12,458 --> 02:10:15,958
It's gotten bigger. It's gotten bigger. It's gotten bigger. It's gotten bigger. It's gotten bigger. It's gotten bigger.

2021
02:10:15,958 --> 02:10:16,625
Someone in the well

2022
02:10:16,625 --> 02:10:18,291
I put one in.

2023
02:10:18,791 --> 02:10:20,333
Makeup umbrella and you directly

2024
02:10:20,333 --> 02:10:21,541
Even if we fight, we can't win

2025
02:10:21,541 --> 02:10:23,250
So, those guys are terrible.

2026
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:25,500
Until now, without a song

2027
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,625
Too much, but small

2028
02:10:27,625 --> 02:10:30,041
Even Chan was killed.

2029
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:35,416
I have a loved one in danger

2030
02:10:35,416 --> 02:10:37,625
When you are suffering from

2031
02:10:38,125 --> 02:10:39,958
He's not always there.

2032
02:10:45,166 --> 02:10:56,958
Someone important to me is in danger.

2033
02:10:56,958 --> 02:10:57,500
Someone important to me is in danger.

2034
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:00,791
I know someone important to me is in danger. The little person knows someone important to me is in danger.

2035
02:11:00,791 --> 02:11:02,416
Tiny humans in danger

2036
02:11:02,416 --> 02:11:03,166
is being hit.

2037
02:11:03,166 --> 02:11:03,583
I have a loved one in danger.

2038
02:11:03,583 --> 02:11:04,833
is suffering from.

2039
02:11:04,833 --> 02:11:09,458
Someone important to me is in danger.

2040
02:11:11,666 --> 02:11:32,291
I will continue to

2041
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:33,833
I am still alive

2042
02:11:33,833 --> 02:11:36,166
The future is well imagined

2043
02:11:36,166 --> 02:11:37,291
It was not possible.

2044
02:11:37,291 --> 02:11:38,291
I had a hard time imagining my future, even in old age.

2045
02:11:38,291 --> 02:11:39,458
I had a hard time imagining my future, even in old age.

2046
02:11:39,458 --> 02:11:41,166
I couldn't imagine myself living a long life, much less the present one. My mother felt the same way.

2047
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,041
So, I'm dying.

2048
02:11:44,041 --> 02:11:46,208
I don't want to see it, I'll kill myself

2049
02:11:46,208 --> 02:11:47,541
I did.

2050
02:11:47,541 --> 02:11:50,916
I'm sure my father, too,

2051
02:11:50,916 --> 02:11:52,416
Are you giving up somewhere?

2052
02:11:52,416 --> 02:11:52,666
but,

2053
02:11:52,666 --> 02:11:54,583
I knew it.

2054
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:56,750
I said too much.

2055
02:11:56,750 --> 02:12:00,041
Too much, but...

2056
02:12:00,041 --> 02:12:02,583
To you, my future

2057
02:12:02,583 --> 02:12:03,916
But I could see it.

2058
02:12:05,416 --> 02:12:06,416
Of course

2059
02:12:06,416 --> 02:12:09,041
So, the year, and even

2060
02:12:09,041 --> 02:12:10,375
Talk about the year

2061
02:12:10,375 --> 02:12:11,583
It was possible.

2062
02:12:13,041 --> 02:12:16,291
I was really happy.

2063
02:12:26,791 --> 02:12:27,791
I am White

2064
02:12:27,791 --> 02:12:28,458
It's better.

2065
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:33,625
Me and Meoto

2066
02:12:33,625 --> 02:12:35,541
Would you be willing?

2067
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:45,333
yes.

2068
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:46,875
I am stronger than anyone

2069
02:12:46,875 --> 02:12:48,958
Become a part of your life

2070
02:12:48,958 --> 02:12:49,458
I will protect you.

2071
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:59,166
In the end, it was all lip service.

2072
02:12:59,166 --> 02:13:01,083
Nothing

2073
02:13:01,083 --> 02:13:02,458
I couldn't.

2074
02:13:02,458 --> 02:13:07,083
What?

2075
02:13:07,083 --> 02:13:11,833
Yay! It's Bray!

2076
02:13:18,458 --> 02:13:21,875
Damn it, soryo!

2077
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,333
After I was murdered,

2078
02:13:49,333 --> 02:13:50,500
Gate of Survival Mars

2079
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:52,625
One person can hide their swordsmanship.

2080
02:13:52,625 --> 02:13:54,291
Attack on the dojo.

2081
02:13:54,708 --> 02:13:57,208
It killed 67 people.

2082
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,458
The method is already

2083
02:13:58,458 --> 02:13:59,791
Head destruction,

2084
02:13:59,791 --> 02:14:01,583
Destroys internal organs.

2085
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:03,333
Most of the pain is caused by crushing

2086
02:14:03,333 --> 02:14:04,583
There was no sign of anything dangerous happening.

2087
02:14:04,583 --> 02:14:07,000
Finished and part of the body

2088
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,041
However, the result was severe damage.

2089
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,500
Now, the jaw, the brain, the eyeballs,

2090
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:14,000
Limbs, general, ceiling

2091
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,041
Splashing on the call wall

2092
02:14:15,041 --> 02:14:16,500
To Hell!

2093
02:14:17,541 --> 02:14:18,541
The deciding factor is Kamiba.

2094
02:14:18,541 --> 02:14:19,541
Not human!

2095
02:14:43,875 --> 02:14:45,708
I remember worshiping the demon.

2096
02:14:45,708 --> 02:14:48,625
A demon appeared in a place that didn't exist

2097
02:14:48,625 --> 02:14:51,583
To the king of

2098
02:14:51,583 --> 02:14:53,791
When I went there,

2099
02:14:53,916 --> 02:14:56,500
Just a human being.

2100
02:14:56,541 --> 02:14:59,500
How boring.

2101
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:00,458
Get out of the way, you're killed.

2102
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:03,541
Just like this.

2103
02:15:07,875 --> 02:15:10,500
About twelve strong demons.

2104
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:10,750
do

2105
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:13,041
I'm thinking about it.

2106
02:15:13,541 --> 02:15:15,333
You can give this

2107
02:15:15,333 --> 02:15:16,250
The amount of blood

2108
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:17,375
Can you stand it?

2109
02:15:20,208 --> 02:15:23,083
yes.

2110
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:27,333
It doesn't matter right now.

2111
02:15:28,583 --> 02:15:34,125
Everything...

2112
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:47,833
Becoming a demon and losing your memory

2113
02:15:47,833 --> 02:15:50,083
And I

2114
02:15:50,083 --> 02:15:52,083
I sought strength.

2115
02:15:58,500 --> 02:15:58,916
queue!

2116
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:08,416
More!

2117
02:16:08,875 --> 02:16:10,500
Shoot some more!

2118
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:16,916
What I wanted to protect

2119
02:16:16,916 --> 02:16:20,000
There's nothing left now

2120
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,166
I say no.

2121
02:16:24,208 --> 02:16:26,416
In a world where I've lost my family,

2122
02:16:26,416 --> 02:16:28,916
I wanted to live

2123
02:16:28,916 --> 02:16:30,875
But that's not the case.

2124
02:16:33,833 --> 02:16:36,625
Over a century of senseless killing

2125
02:16:36,625 --> 02:16:38,833
Repeat the force,

2126
02:16:39,875 --> 02:16:41,875
Oh my goodness, rainbow eyes

2127
02:16:41,875 --> 02:16:45,375
So, in terms of national origin,

2128
02:16:45,375 --> 02:16:48,083
That's a boring story.

2129
02:16:53,791 --> 02:16:56,625
When I died, I was with three people.

2130
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:57,500
Same place

2131
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:59,250
I can't go.

2132
02:17:00,625 --> 02:17:02,666
I was reminded of that.

2133
02:17:02,666 --> 02:17:06,958
What a past.

2134
02:17:08,041 --> 02:17:09,958
Human name, or

2135
02:17:09,958 --> 02:17:11,875
A fragile weakling!

2136
02:17:13,875 --> 02:17:17,916
Dies quickly, breaks down, disappears

2137
02:17:17,916 --> 02:17:19,041
It's gone!

2138
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,041
Not yet dead

2139
02:17:24,041 --> 02:17:26,291
No, that's ridiculous!

2140
02:17:28,166 --> 02:17:30,500
I have to do it now.

2141
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:33,541
When played here,

2142
02:17:33,541 --> 02:17:35,000
There's no turning back now!

2143
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:44,041
It was during the battle!

2144
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,916
The head, the head regenerates

2145
02:17:48,916 --> 02:17:49,500
It's happening!

2146
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:53,250
I cut off his head!

2147
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:04,083
Red murder, Meshiki, Yagara!

2148
02:18:05,958 --> 02:18:07,708
Is this one still moving?

2149
02:18:08,541 --> 02:18:10,125
Cut off your head as many times as you want!

2150
02:18:10,416 --> 02:18:11,041
We can win!

2151
02:18:11,666 --> 02:18:12,333
With Giryu

2152
02:18:12,333 --> 02:18:13,458
Red Tani in style!

2153
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:17,958
With Giryu

2154
02:18:17,958 --> 02:18:18,416
In style, Red Kill,

2155
02:18:18,416 --> 02:18:18,750
Eyelids, yagara!

2156
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:27,791
Red murder, Meshiki, Yagara!

2157
02:18:27,791 --> 02:18:27,833
Red murder, blindfold, yagara! Red murder, blindfold, yagara!

2158
02:18:27,833 --> 02:18:30,583
Red murder, Meshiki, Yagara!

2159
02:18:41,625 --> 02:18:43,416
I hate weak people!

2160
02:18:46,041 --> 02:18:48,791
The weak ones, raw,

2161
02:18:48,791 --> 02:18:51,041
Noble, no fighting, thread

2162
02:18:51,041 --> 02:18:52,375
Poison it!

2163
02:18:53,666 --> 02:18:54,666
Hard to see!

2164
02:18:56,541 --> 02:18:58,625
The weak one,

2165
02:18:58,625 --> 02:18:59,750
Not enough mandrels!

2166
02:19:00,875 --> 02:19:02,750
Soon it will be time to protect yourself!

2167
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:05,958
Protective Ignorance

2168
02:19:05,958 --> 02:19:07,083
And killed someone!

2169
02:19:09,666 --> 02:19:11,458
Tsukasa's precious solution

2170
02:19:11,458 --> 02:19:14,583
Covered in rice, my father

2171
02:19:14,583 --> 02:19:16,041
We can't even protect our rights!

2172
02:19:20,166 --> 02:19:22,083
That's right, I

2173
02:19:22,083 --> 02:19:26,250
I wanted to kill him...

2174
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:30,625
Why why why!

2175
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:32,000
The winner flew away!

2176
02:19:34,625 --> 02:19:35,375
I hit him.

2177
02:19:35,375 --> 02:19:36,000
Then it won't stop!

2178
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:47,500
Combat is impossible!

2179
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:49,000
Fighting is impossible! Fighting is impossible! The redness is in Rengoku-san's hands.

2180
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,208
Let's take out the used mats

2181
02:19:50,208 --> 02:19:50,708
This is what they say!

2182
02:19:54,833 --> 02:19:55,750
Bring along Giriyu

2183
02:19:55,750 --> 02:19:57,458
Attack unseen!

2184
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:03,416
Don't mind me!

2185
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:15,166
If you don't kill me...

2186
02:20:15,166 --> 02:20:18,583
I hate weak people!

2187
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:53,250
Combat is impossible!

2188
02:20:53,250 --> 02:21:01,500
By myself, by myself…

2189
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:04,958
Me…

2190
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:08,000
Why me?

2191
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,375
Did you attack?

2192
02:21:10,541 --> 02:21:11,708
Why…

2193
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:17,875
For a moment, redness turned to gratitude.

2194
02:21:17,875 --> 02:21:19,125
It smelled.

2195
02:21:20,833 --> 02:21:21,791
Why did you laugh?

2196
02:21:26,916 --> 02:21:27,791
Enough!

2197
02:21:28,208 --> 02:21:28,708
Stop it!

2198
02:21:29,291 --> 02:21:30,458
Don't play!

2199
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:33,500
The game is over!

2200
02:21:34,541 --> 02:21:35,875
I've lost!

2201
02:21:38,458 --> 02:21:40,583
At that moment, I was toast!

2202
02:21:41,833 --> 02:21:43,833
Generated, dignified,

2203
02:21:43,833 --> 02:21:45,750
It was a brilliant move!

2204
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:49,083
Perfect your enemy's movements

2205
02:21:49,083 --> 02:21:50,833
Read and rotate at the last minute!

2206
02:21:51,833 --> 02:21:53,625
The enemy launches an attack.

2207
02:21:53,625 --> 02:21:55,000
Cut forward!

2208
02:21:56,291 --> 02:21:56,458
It's over!

2209
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:00,541
Poorly,

2210
02:22:00,541 --> 02:22:02,875
I want to go to hell...

2211
02:22:06,541 --> 02:22:07,000
Where to go

2212
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Do you want to?

2213
02:22:16,333 --> 02:22:17,875
My feet stopped...

2214
02:22:20,625 --> 02:22:23,458
Dad...are you okay now?

2215
02:22:23,833 --> 02:22:27,791
Isn't it painful?

2216
02:22:29,375 --> 02:22:31,500
It's okay, white people...

2217
02:22:33,041 --> 02:22:36,333
Thank you...

2218
02:22:41,291 --> 02:22:43,500
Sorry, Dad...

2219
02:22:43,583 --> 02:22:45,708
Sorry, I'll try again

2220
02:22:45,708 --> 02:22:47,375
There was no… no good.

2221
02:22:47,375 --> 02:22:50,458
It was... it has nothing to do with that...

2222
02:22:52,041 --> 02:22:55,750
How are you?

2223
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:58,125
Well, a son is a son...

2224
02:22:58,166 --> 02:23:01,000
A disciple is a disciple...even in death

2225
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,125
I won't abandon you...

2226
02:23:03,875 --> 02:23:05,708
There are many places in Japan.

2227
02:23:05,708 --> 02:23:08,250
I can't go, but...

2228
02:23:10,041 --> 02:23:15,458
Shia... I want to become stronger

2229
02:23:15,458 --> 02:23:17,791
Wasn't it...?

2230
02:23:18,041 --> 02:23:19,000
This is you

2231
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,458
Is this the end...?

2232
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:22,583
Redness...

2233
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:27,458
That's right... I'm strong

2234
02:23:27,458 --> 02:23:30,541
I want to become stronger...

2235
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:32,458
Because I was cut from the group

2236
02:23:32,458 --> 02:23:34,125
What... a contest?

2237
02:23:34,541 --> 02:23:37,958
It doesn't matter...Kill them all.

2238
02:23:37,958 --> 02:23:41,500
I'll do it...I'm still strong

2239
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:46,166
I promise...

2240
02:23:46,166 --> 02:23:48,708
If we don't protect it...

2241
02:23:53,333 --> 02:23:56,291
oh…

2242
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:00,875
White child...

2243
02:24:02,125 --> 02:24:03,500
thank you…

2244
02:24:04,166 --> 02:24:07,375
Enough already...

2245
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:11,708
That's enough...

2246
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:15,083
Enough already...red!

2247
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:28,708
I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Protect me

2248
02:24:28,708 --> 02:24:31,250
Sorry I wasn't there... with the Ambassador

2249
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:33,541
Sorry I don't smoke...

2250
02:24:33,791 --> 02:24:36,250
No matter how many promises you keep,

2251
02:24:36,250 --> 02:24:38,000
I didn't... I forgive you.

2252
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,416
Y-You forgave me.

2253
02:24:40,416 --> 02:24:45,625
Please...forgive me...

2254
02:24:45,625 --> 02:24:48,333
About us... About you... About you

2255
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:50,458
About you guys...

2256
02:24:50,458 --> 02:24:51,666
Thank you for aiming for me

2257
02:24:51,666 --> 02:24:55,041
It was... the original Shiraji

2258
02:24:55,041 --> 02:24:55,958
Return to

2259
02:24:55,958 --> 02:24:58,541
I'm glad...

2260
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:11,000
Welcome back... Shiroji...

2261
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:14,750
Yo!

2262
02:25:14,958 --> 02:25:15,375
White child!

2263
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:17,041
Welcome back!

2264
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:21,833
White baby...White baby...White baby...

2265
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:28,208
I'm home…

2266
02:25:29,208 --> 02:25:30,958
I'm back...

2267
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:36,916
welcome home…

2268
02:25:36,916 --> 02:25:39,166
you…

2269
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,541
oh…

2270
02:26:07,875 --> 02:26:10,625
Gone...

2271
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:23,166
It's over...

02:26:27,458 --> 02:26:31,750
Hurry...Next...Tamayosan

2273
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:38,958
In...the place...

2274
02:26:41,500 --> 02:26:44,500
Rather than relying on...

2275
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:57,125
Don't rely on me... Don't rely on me...

2276
02:26:57,541 --> 02:26:58,416
I'd rather rely on you... I'd rather rely on you... I'd rather rely on you... I'd rather rely on you... I'd rather rely on you... I'd rather rely on you... I'd rather rely on you... I'd rather rely on you...

2277
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:17,875
Rather than relying on... relying on

2278
02:27:17,875 --> 02:27:19,500
Rather... more reliable...

2279
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:28,333
Rather than trusting... Akazano...

2280
02:27:28,333 --> 02:27:31,666
The benefits are gone...

2281
02:27:33,833 --> 02:27:36,500
Ashiki yuд...

2282
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:43,916
Akaza... Will you defeat me?

2283
02:27:43,916 --> 02:27:45,958
Wasn't it...?

2284
02:27:48,541 --> 02:27:49,833
Further insight

2285
02:27:49,833 --> 02:27:51,791
Opening the way to

2286
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:56,708
Abandoning nature

2287
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:06,458
How many thousand?

2288
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:18,625
Akazad's Maybe

2289
02:28:18,625 --> 02:28:19,833
Are you dead?

2290
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,500
For a moment, I felt strange.

2291
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:25,875
But it's just my imagination.

2292
02:28:25,875 --> 02:28:29,958
Akazad or something else

2293
02:28:29,958 --> 02:28:32,083
Death becomes a living thing

2294
02:28:32,083 --> 02:28:33,458
So now it's Axie, Axie

2295
02:28:35,166 --> 02:28:36,250
Because he's dead

2296
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:37,125
I don't know

2297
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:43,166
Umm, what was it again?

2298
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:46,125
Oh, that's right.

2299
02:28:47,125 --> 02:28:48,208
Ask your name

2300
02:28:48,208 --> 02:28:48,750
